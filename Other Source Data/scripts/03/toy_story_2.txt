Walt Disney Pictures presents a Pixar Animation Studios film Toy Story 2. 
Gamma Quadrant. Sector 4. 
Buzz Lightyear (B): Buzz Lightyear mission log. All signs point to 
   this planet as the location of Zurg's fortress but there seems to 
   be no sign of intelligent life anywhere. 
Emperor Zurg (Z): Come to me, my prey. 
B: To infinity and beyond! 
Z: So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear, for the last time. 
B: Not today, Zurg! 
Rex (R): Oh, no! No! No, no, no no. 
B: Oh, you almost had him. 
R: I'm never gonna defeat Zurg! 
B: Sure, you will, Rex. In fact, you're a better Buzz than I am. 
R: But look at my little arms! I can't press the 'fire' button and jump 
   at the same time! 
Woody (W): Where is it? Where is it? 
B: Uh, Woody? 
W: Huh? 
B & R: Ooh. 
B: Hang on, cowboy! Woody, are you all right? 
W: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, Buzz. Okay. Here's your list of things to 
   do while I'm gone. Batteries need to be changed. Toys in the bottom 
   of the chest need to be rotated. Oh, and make sure everyone attends 
   Mr. Spell's seminar on what to do if you or part of you is swallowed. 
   Okay? Okay. Good. Okay. 
B: Woody, you haven't found your hat yet, have you? 
W: No! And Andy's leaving for cowboy camp any minute, and I can't find it 
   anywhere! 
B: Don't worry, Woody. In just a few hours, you'll be sitting around a 
   campfire with Andy making delicious, hot schmoes. 
W: They're called s'mores, Buzz. 
B: Right. Right. Of course. Has anyone found Woody's hat yet? 
Sergeant: Keep looking, men. Dig deeper! Negatory. Still searching. 
Hamm (H): The lawn gnome in the yard next door says it's not in the yard, 
   but he'll keep lookin'. 
Bo Peep (BP): It's not in Molly's room. We've looked everywhere. 
Mr. Potato Head (PH): I found it. 
W: You found my hat? 
PH: Your hat? No. The missus lost her earring. Oh, my little sweeet potato! 
Mrs. Potato Head (MPH): Oh, you found it! Oh, it's so nice to have a big, 
   strong spud around the house. Ooh! 
W: Oh, great. That's just great. This'll be the first year I miss cowboy 
   camp, all because of my stupid hat! 
BP: Woody, look under your boot. 
W: Don't be silly. My hat is not under my boot. 
BP: Would you just look? 
W: You see? No hat. Just the word 'Andy.' 
BP: Uh-huh. And the boy who wrote that would take you to camp with him 
   with or without your hat. 
W: I'm sorry, Bo. It's just that I've been lookin' forward to this all 
   year. It's my one time with just me and Andy. 
BP: You're cute when you care. 
W: Bo, not in front of Buzz. 
BP: Let him look. 
R: Miss Peep, your sheep! 
Al: This is Al from Al's Toy Barn, and I'm sittin on good deals. 
R: Whoa! 
A: Ow! I think I'm feeling a deal hatching right now. Whoa! Let's see 
   what we got. We got boats for a buck. Beanies for a buck -- 
W: Rex, turn it off! Someone's gonna hear! 
R: Which one is off? 
A: Buck-buck-buck! And that's cheap-cheap-cheap! So hurry on down -- 
H: For cryin' out loud, it's this one. I despise that chicken. 
Slinky Dog (S): Fellas! Fellas! Okay, I got some good news, and I got 
   some bad news. 
MPH: What news? 
S: The good news is I found your hat, Woody. 
W: My hat! Slink, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Where'd 
   you find it? 
S: Well, that's the bad news. 
R: Oh, it's Buster! 
Seargeant: Canine alert! Man your battle stations! Let's move, move, 
   move! 
BP: Woody! Hide! Quick! 
W: Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay! You found me! Buster, all right. 
   Hey, how did he do, Hamm? 
H: Looks like a new record. 
W: Okay, boy. Sit. Reach for the sky. Gotcha! Great job, boy. 
    Who's gonna miss me when I'm gone, huh? Who's gonna miss me? 
   Who's gonna miss me? 
Andy's Mom (AM): Andy, you got all your stuff? 
W: Have a good weekend, everybody. I'll see you Sunday night. 
Andy (A): It's in my room. Stick 'em up. I guess we'll work on that 
   later. Hey, Woody. Ready to go to cowboy camp? 
AM: Andy, honey, come on. Five minutes, and we're leaving. 
A: Five minutes. Hmm. Help, help! Somebody help me! Let her go, 
    evil Dr. Pork Chop! Never! You must choose, Sheriff Woody. How 
    shall she die? Shark, or death by monkeys? Choose! I choose 
    Buzz Lightyear! What? That's not a choice! To infinity and 
    beyond! I'll save you, Miss Peep. My hero. Thanks, Buzz. No 
    problem, buddy. You should never tangle with the unstoppable 
    duo of Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Oh, no. 
AM: Andy, let's go! Molly's already in her car seat. 
A: But, Mom, Woody's arm wrecked. 
AM: Oh, no. Maybe we can fix him on the way. 
A: No, just leave him. 
AM: I'm sorry, honey, but you know toys don't last forever. 
R: What happened? 
PH: Woody's been shelved. 
W: Andy! 
S: Woody? 
BP: Woody? Honey, are you okay? 
A: Yee-hah! Ride 'em, cowboy! 
W: He's back? Hey, everybody! Andy's back! He's back early from 
    cowboy camp! 
H: Places, everybody! Andy's coming! 
A: Yeah! Hey, Woody! Did you miss me? Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap. 
    Ride 'em, cowboy! Ohh, I forgot. You're broken. I don't wanna 
    play with you anymore. 
W: No, Andy! No! No, Andy! No! Andy! Andy! 
A: Bye, Woody. 
W: No! No! Andy! Wheezy, is that you? 
Wheezy (Wh): Hey, Woody. 
W: What are you doing up here? I thought Mom took you to get your 
    squeaker fixed months ago. Andy was so upset. 
Wh: Nah. She just told him that to calm him down and then put me 
    on the shelf. 
W: Why didn't you yell for help? 
Wh: Well, I tried squeaking. But I'm still broken. No one could 
    hear me. Besides, the dust aggravates my condition. What's 
    the point in prolonging the inevitable? We're all just one 
    stitch away from here to there. 
W: Yard sale? Yard sale! Yard sale! Guys, wake up, wake up! 
    There's a yard sale outside! 
B: Yard sale? 
W: Sarge, emergency roll call! 
Seargent: Sir, yes sir! Red alert! All civilians fall in position 
    now! Single file! Let's move, move, move! 
B: Hamm? 
H: Here. 
B: Potato Head, Mr. and Mrs.? 
PH & MPH: Here. 
B: Troikas. Check, check, check, check, check. 
R: I hate yard sales! Someone's coming! 
AM: Okay. Let's see what's up here. 
Wh: Bye, Woody. 
W: Wheezy! Think, think, Woody. Think, think, think. Ooh -- Hey! 
    Here, boy. Here, Buster! Up here! No, no, no, no, no! Okay, 
    boy. To the yard sale! Hyah! 
PH: What's going on? He's nuts. 
S: His arm ain't that bad. 
R: Don't do it, Woody! We love you! 
W: Careful on the steps, now. Okay, boy. Let's go. And keep it 
    casual. Not that casual. 
H: Piggy bank coming through, coming through. 
R: Is he out there? 
B: There he is. 
R: He's in the box! 
H: He's selling himself for twenty-five cents! 
W: Oh, Woody, you're worth more than that. 
B: Hold on. Hold on. He's got something. It's Wheezy! 
Toys: Wheezy! 
R: It's not a suicide. It's a rescue! 
W: Good boy, Buster. Hold still. There. There you go, pal. 
Wh: Bless you, Woody. 
W: All right, now. Back to Andy's room. Hyah! 
B: Way to go, cowboy. 
S: Golly bob howdy! 
Wh: Woody, I'm slipping! 
Kid: Mommy -- Mommy, look! Look at this! Mommy, look! It's a 
    cowboy dolly! 
R: Hey, that's not her toy! 
S: What does that little gal think she's doing? 
Kid: Mommy, Mommy, can we get it? Please? Mommy, please? 
Kid's Mom: Oh, honey. You don't want that toy. It's broken. 
Woody's Voicebox: There's a snake in my boot. 
Al: Original hand-painted face. Natural dye, blanket-stitched 
    vest! Little rip. Fixable. Oh, if only you had your 
    hand-stitched, polyvinyl -- A hat! I found him! I found 
    him! I found him! 
AM: Buster! Quiet down! Excuse me. Can I help you? 
S: Yes. You can help take his paws off my pal. 
Al: I'll give you, uh, fifty cents for all this junk. 
AM: Oh, now, how did this get down here? 
B: Hand her the sheriff. Nice and easy. 
Al: Five dollars. 
AM: I'm sorry, it's an old family toy. 
Al: Wait! 
B: Now just walk away. The other way. 
Al: I'll give you fifty bucks for it. 
PH: Fifty bucks ain't bad. 
AM: It's not for sale. 
Al: Everything's for sale. We'll trade. You like my watch? 
AM: Sorry. 
B: He's safe. Way to go! 
S: She showed him! 
AM: Molly, don't touch that, sweetie. 
PH: Yeah, go home, Mr. Fancy Car. 
B: Hold on. 
H: What's up? 
R: What is it, Buzz? 
Toys: What's happening? What's he doing? 
R: I can't watch! Can someone cover my eyes? 
B: He's stealing Woody! 
R: What? He can't take Woody! It's illegal! 
S: Where's he going? 
R: Do something. 
BP: Buzz! 
PH: Get him, Buzz. 
Person: Where's the red jacket? 
BP: Why would someone steal Woody?
H: All right. Let's review this one more time. At 
    precisely 8:32-ish, Exhibit 'A,' Woody, was 
    kidnapped. Exhibit 'B,' a composite sketch of 
    the kidnapper. 
BP: He didn't have a beard like that. 
H: Fine. Etch, give him a shave. 
S: The kidnapper was bigger than that. 
H: Oh, picky, picky, picky. 
PH: Let's just go straight to Exhibit 'F.' The 
    kidnapper's vehicle. Now, the vehicle fled the 
    scene in this direction. 
H: Your eyes are in backwards. It went the other way. 
PH: Hey, put a cork in it. 
R: How do you spell 'FBI'? 
PH: My crime scene! 
H: Oh, why don't you watch where you're going, 'Godspilla'? 
R: I didn't know there was a crime scene. 
B: Excuse me. Excuse me. A little quite please. Thank you. 
H: Huh? 
Mr. Spell (MS): Lazy toy brain. Lousy try, Brian. 
R: What are you doing, Buzz? 
B: It's some sort of message encoded on that vehicle's ID tag. 
MS: Liz try bran. 
PH: It's just a license plate. It's just a jumble of letters. 
H: Yeah, and there are about 3.5 million registered cars in 
    the tri-county area alone. 
MS: Lou's thigh burn. 
PH: Oh, this can't help. Let's leave Buzz to play with his toys. 
B: Toy. Toy. Toy. Hold on! 
MS: Al's Toy Barn. 
PH: Al's Toy Barn! 
B: Etch, draw that man in a chicken suit. 
R: It's the chicken man! 
B: That's our guy. 
H: I knew there was something I didn't like about that chicken. 
Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be right there. 
    And we're gonna do this commercial in one take, do you hear me, 
    because I am in the middle of something really important. 
    You, my little cowboy friend, are gonna make me big 
    buck-buck-bucks. 
W: Andy! 
Al: I can't believe I have to drive all the way to work on a 
    Saturday. All the way to work! 
W: What? Whoa! Hey! Stop! Horsey, stop! Stop! Sit, boy! Stop it! 
    Sit, I said! Whoa! Whoa. 
Jessie (J): Yee-hah! It's you! It's you! It's you, it's you, it's 
    you! It's really you! 
W: What's me? 
J: Whoo-whee! 
Woody's voicebox: There's a snake in my boot. 
J: Ha! It is you! 
W: Please stop saying that. 
J: Prospector said someday you'd come. Sweet mother of Abraham 
    Lincoln! The Prospector! He'll wanna meet ya! Say hello to 
    the Prospector! 
W: It -- it's a box. 
J: He's mint in the box. Never been opened. 
Prospector (P): Turn me around, Bullseye, so I can see. Why, 
    the prodigal son has returned. 
J: Yee-hah! It's you! It's you! You're here! It's you! It's 
    you! It's you! 
W: Okay, I'm officially freaked out now. 
P: Oh, we've waited countless years for this day. It's good to 
    see you, Woody. 
W: Listen, I don't know wh -- hey, how do you know my name? 
J: Everybody knows your name, Wood-y. 
P: Why, you don't know who you are, do you? Bullseye? 
W: That's me. Wow. Holy cow. 
Announcer: Cowboy Crunchies, the cereal that's sugar-frosted 
    and dipped in chocolate proudly presents... 
Chorus (C): Woody's Roundup. Come on, it's time to play. 
    There's Jessie, the yodelling cowgirl. 
J (on TV): Yodel-ay-hee-hoo! 
J: Look it! That's me! 
C: Bullseye, he's Woody's horse. 
Man: He's a smart one. 
C: Meet the old Prospector. 
P (TV): Has anyone seen my pick? 
C: And the man himself, of course. It's time for Sheriff Woody. 
    He's the very best. He's the rootinest, tootinest cowboy 
    in the wild, wild west. Woody's Roundup. 
R: I can't find it! It doesn't seem to be on any of these 
    stations. 
B: Keep looking. 
H: You're going too slow. Let me take the wheel. 
R: It's too fast. How can you even tell what's on? 
H: I can tell. 
All: Stop! Back, back, back! 
H: Too late, I'm in the forties. Gotta go round the horn, 
    it's faster. 
All: Back, back! Stop! 
Al (TV): And look for the giant chicken! 
B: Now, Etch! That's where I need to go. 
R: You can't go, Buzz. You'll never make it there. 
B: Woody once risked his life to save me. I couldn't call 
    myself his friend if I weren't willing to do the same. 
    So who's with me? 
MPH: I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes and your angry 
    eyes, just in case. 
BP: This is for Woody when you find him. 
B: All right, but I don't thin it'll mean the same coming 
    from me. 
Wh: Mr. Buzz Lightyear, you just gotta save my pal Woody. 
B: I'll do my best, son. 
PH: Okay, fellas. Let's roll. Geronimo! 
R: You'd think, with all my video game experience, 
    I'd be feeling more prepared. 
S: The idea is to let go. 
B: We'll be back before Andy gets home. 
MPH: Don't talk to any toy you don't know! 
B: To Al's Toy Barn and beyond! 
J (TV): They don't call this the old abandoned mine for 
    nothin', Prospector. I reckon we oughta get outta here. 
P: (TV): Where's my gold? Hold on. I'll light me a candle. 
    This sure is a fast-burning wick. 
J (TV): Blast us to smithereens! That there's dynamite! 
P: (TV): Holy tarnation! 
J (TV): I'll call for help. Yodel-ay-hee-hoo! Hey, critters, 
    go get Sheriff Woody. Now scurry! 
W (TV): Good job, Bullseye, I reckon the new schoolhouse is 
    finally done. What's that? Jessie and Prospector are 
    trapped in the old abandoned mine and Prospector just 
    lit a stick of dynamite thinking it was a candle and 
    now they're about to be blown to smithereens? 
Rabbit: Mm-hmm. 
W (TV): Ride like the wind, Bullseye! 
P (TV): You're fannin' the flames, Jessie! It takes brains 
    to put out that fire. Yow! My biscuits are burnin'! 
Announcer: Will Woody and Bullseye land to safety? Can they 
    reach Jessie and Stinky Pete in time? Tune in next week 
    for the exciting conclusion: 'Woody's Finest Hour.' 
W: All right! All right! Next tape! Hey, w--wait. What 
    happened? What happens next? Come on! Let's see the 
    next episode! 
P: That's it. 
W: What? 
P: The show was cancelled after that. 
W: Wait. What about the gold mine and the cute little 
    critters and the dynamite?  That was a great show! 
    I mean, why cancel it? 
P: Two words: Sput-nik. Once the astronauts went up, 
    children only wanted to play with space toys. 
W: I know how that feels. But still, my own show. I mean, 
    look at all this stuff! 
J: Didn't you know? Why, you're valuable property! 
W: I wish the guys could see this. Hey-howdy-hey! That's me. 
    I'm on a yo-yo. Oh, hey. Nice teeth. And yet, still a 
    good-looking guy. Oh, it's a bank! Cool. Wh--what do 
    you do? You push the hat and out co -- oh, out come 
    bubbles. Clever. Oh, wow. Hey, what's this thing do? 
    I get it. 'There's a snake in my boot.' Oh, hey, 
    Bullseye. Go long! Go long! Whoo! A record player! 
    I haven't seen one of these in ages. Okay, now. Slow. 
J: Oh, that's funny, Bullseye. 
W: Hop on, cowgirl! Think fast! 
J: Oh! 
W: Not bad. 
Record: It's time for Woody's Roundup. 
J: Whee! 
Record: He's the very best. He's the rootinest tootinest 
    cowboy -- 
J: Look at us! We're a complete set! 
P: Now it's on to the museum. 
W: Museum? What museum? 
P: The museum. We're being sold to the Konishi Toy 
    Museum in Tokyo. 
J: That's in Japan! 
W: Japan? No, no, no, no, no. I can't go to Japan. 
J: What do you mean? 
W: I got to get back home to my owner, Andy. Hey, look, 
    look, see? 
J: He still has an owner! 
P: Oh, my goodness. 
J: No. Can't go. I can't do storage again. I just can't! 
P: Jessie. Jessie. 
J: I won't go back in the dark! 
W: What's the matter? What's wrong with her? 
P: Well, we've been in storage for a long time, 
    waiting for you. 
W: Why me? 
P: The museum's only interested in the collection if 
    you're in it, Woody. 
    Without you, we go back into storage. It's that simple. 
J: It's not fair! How can you do this to me? 
W: Hey, look, I'm sorry, but this is all a big mistake. 
    You see, I was in this yard sale -- 
P: Yard sale? Why were you in a yard sale if you have 
    an owner? 
W: Well, I wasn't supposed to be there. I was trying to 
    save another toy when -- 
P: Was it because you're damaged? Hmm? 
    Did this Andy break you? 
W: Yeah, but -- No, no, no, no, no! It was -- 
    it was an accident. I mean -- 
J: Sounds like he really loves you. 
W: It's not like that, okay? And I'm not going to 
    any museum! 
J: Well, I'm not going back into storage! 
P: Al's coming! 
P: Go! Go on, Jessie. Jessie, look at me. 
J: Oh, oh, oh. 
P: I promise you'll come out of the box. Now go! Go! 
Al: It's show time! Oh, money, baby. Money, money, 
    money. And now, the main attraction. No! His arm! 
    Where's his arm? Oh...no. No, no, no, no! 
    What am I gonna do? I know. I know. Come on! 
    Come on! Come on! Pick up the phone! 
Geri (G): Hello? 
Al: It's me. It's Al. I got an emergency here. 
G: Well, I'm busy. 
Al: Yes, we're all busy. Look. It has to be tonight. 
    All right. All right. But first thing in the 
    morning. 
W: It's gone! I can't believe it! My arm is 
    completely gone! 
P: All right, come here. Let me see that. Oh, it's 
    just a popped seam, easily repaired. 
    You should consider yourself lucky. 
W: Lucky? Are you shrink-wrapped? I am missing 
    my arm! 
J: Big deal. Let him go. I'm sure his precious Andy 
    is dying to play with a one-armed cowboy doll. 
P: Why, Jessie, you know he wouldn't last an hour 
    on the streets in his condition. It's a dangerous 
    world out there for a toy. 
H: All right. Nobody look until I get my cork back in. 
B: Good work, men. Two blocks down and only nineteen 
    more to go. 
All: What? Nineteen? 
PH: Are we gonna do this all night? My parts are 
    killing me. 
B: Come on, fellas. Did Woody give up when Sid had 
    me strapped to a rocket? 
All: No. 
B: No. And did he give up when you threw him out of 
    the back of that moving van? 
PH: Oh you had to bring that up. 
B: No, he didn't! We have a friend in need, and we 
    will not rest until he's safe in Andy's room! 
    Now, let's move out!
Announcer: And that concludes our broadcast day. 
W: Bullseye. Bullseye, go, go, go, go. Oh, tsk. 
    Come on. You don't wanna help me. I'm the bad 
    guy. You're gonna go back in storage because 
    of me, remember? Just go. Bullseye -- all right. 
    All right. But you have got to keep quiet. 
    Come on. Over here. Attaboy. Okay, Bullseye. 
    Upsy-daisy. Psst, Bullseye. Cut it out. Stop 
    it. Psst. Stop it, Bullseye. Stop it. Stop it. 
    Stop it. Phew. 
C: Woody's Roundup. Come on, it's time to play. 
Al: No, officer, I swear. What? Uh -- oh. 
    Get in there. There you go. Cheap case. 
    Where is the remote? Where is the remote? 
    Why don't I put it in the same place 
    every ti -- oh, here it is. 
W: What is your problem? Look, I'm sorry I can't 
    help you guys out. Really, I am. 
    But you didn't have to go and pull a stunt 
    like that. 
J: What? You think I did that? 
W: Oh, right, right. The TV just happened to turn 
    on and the remote magically ended up in 
    front of you! 
J: You calling me a liar? 
W: Well, if the boot fits -- 
J: Say that again. 
W: If the boot fits. 
J: Okay, cowboy. Yah! How do you like that? 
    Take it back! Take it back! 
W: Don't think just 'cause you're a girl, 
    I'm gonna take it easy on you. 
P: Jessie, Woody, you stop this at once. 
    I don't know how that television turned on, 
    but fighting about it isn't helping anything. 
W: If I had both my arms -- 
P: The fact is, you don't, Woody, so I suggest 
    you just wait until morning. The cleaner will 
    come, fix your arm -- 
W: And then I'm outta here! Oh, no, no, Bullseye, 
    don't take it that way. It's just that Andy -- 
J: Andy, Andy, Andy. That's all he ever talks about.
H: Hey, Buzz, can we slow down? May I remind you that 
    some of us are carrying over six dollars in change? 
R: Losing health units. Must rest. 
B: Is everyone present and accounted for? 
S: Not quite everyone. 
B: Who's behind? 
S: Mine. 
H: Hey, guys! Why do the toys cross the road? 
B: Not now, Hamm. 
R: Oh, I love riddles. Why? 
H: To get to the chicken on the other side! 
R: The chicken! Oh, well, we tried. 
B: We have to cross. 
PH: What the -- you're not turning me into a mashed potato. 
S: I may not be a smart dog, but I know what roadkill is. 
B: There must be a safe way. Okay. Here's our chance. 
    Ready. Set. Go. Drop! Go! Drop! I said 'drop'! Go! 
    Drop. Go. 
PH: That went well. 
B: Good job, troops. We're that much closer to Woody. 
Al: Oh, thank goodness you're here. 
G: Is the specimen ready for cleaning? 
Al: So, uh, how long is this gonna take? 
G: You can't rush art. 
S: Oh, no. It's closed. 
PH: We're no preschool toys, Slinky. We can read. 
Man: Hey, Joe, you're late. We've got a ton of toys 
    to unload in the back. 
Joe: All right. All right. I'm coming, I'm coming. 
B: All right, let's go. 
R: But the sign says it's closed. 
B: No, no, no, no. All together. Now! 
S: Whoa, Nelly! How are we going to find Woody 
    in this place? 
B: Look for Al. We find Al, we find Woody. Now move out! 
H: Woody! 
PH: Woody! 
G: There you go. He's for display only. 
    You handle him too much, he's not gonna last. 
Al: It's amazing. You're a genius. He's just like new. 
B: Wow. I could use one of those. 
R: You know, they make it so you can't defeat Zurg 
    unless you buy this book. It's extortion. That's 
    what it is. Hey, I always thought the golden sector 
    was the only -- 
H: I thought we could search in style. 
PH: Nice going there, Hamm. So how about letting a 
    toy with fingers drive? 
B: Am I really that fat? Ow! What are you doing? 
Ultimate Buzz (UB): You're in direct violation of 
    Code 6404.5 stating all space rangers are to 
    be in hyper-sleep until awakened by authorized 
    personnel. 
B: Oh, no. 
UB: You're breaking ranks, ranger. Buzz Lightyear 
    to Star Command. I've got an 
    AWOL space ranger. 
B: Tell me I wasn't this deluded. 
UB: No back talk! I have a laser, and I will use it. 
B: You mean the laser that's a light bulb? 
UB: Has your mind been melded? You could've killed me, 
    space ranger. Or should I say, 'traitor'? 
B: I don't have time for this. 
UB: Halt! I order you to halt! 
B: Listen to me. Listen. Wait. 
S: We've been down this aisle already. 
PH: We've never been down this aisle. It's pink. 
S: Face it. We're lost. 
H: Back it up. Back it up. 
Barbie: What a great party! 
Limboing Barbies: How low can you go? How low can you go? 
H: Excuse me, ladies. Does anyone know where we might 
    find the Al of Al's Toy Barn? 
Tour Guide Barbie (TGB): I can help. I'm Tour Guide Barbie. 
    Please keep your hands and accessories inside the car, 
    and no flash photography. Thank you. 
PH: I'm a married spud. I'm a married spud. 
    I'm a married spud. 
H: Then make room for the single fellas. 
TGB: To our right is the Hot Wheels aisle. 
    Developed in 1967, the original series had sixteen cars, 
    including the Corvette. 
S: I beg your pardon, ma'am, but where's Al's office? 
TGB: Please hold all questions until the end of the tour. 
    Thank you. 
R: It says how you defeat Zurg! Look! 
PH: Hey, get this outta here, Geekosaur. 
TGB: Excuse me, sir. 
PH: Look out! 
H: Stop, stop, stop! Turn into the spin, Barbie! 
R: My source of power! No! Come back! Hey! Wait up! Hey! 
    Come on! Slow down! 
    Dinosaur overboard! Slow down! 
TGB: Remain seated, please. Permanece sentados, por favor. 
B: Ow! Listen to me. Listen to me. You're not really a 
    space ranger. You're a toy. We're all toys. 
    Do you hear me? 
UB: Well, that should hold you until the court marshal. 
B: Let me go! You don't realize what you're doing! 
TGB: And this is the Buzz Lightyear aisle. Back in 1995, 
    shortsighted retailers did not order enough dolls to 
    meet demand. 
H: Hey, Buzz! 
UB: Halt! Who goes there? 
PH: Quit clowning around and get in the car! 
R: Buzz, Buzz, I know how to defeat Zurg! 
UB: You do? 
R: Come on, I'll tell you on the way. 
B: No, no, guys! You've got the wrong Buzz! 
    You've got the wrong Buzz! 
H: Say, where'd you get the cool belt, Buzz? 
UB: Well, slotted pig, they're standard issue. 
B: No! No! 
Al: It's like printing my own money. Yeah? What? Oh, oh, 
    Mr. Konishi. Yes, uh, I have the pictures right here. 
    In fact, I'm in my car right now on my way to the 
    office to fax them to you. I'm going through a tunnel! 
    I'm breaking up! 
W: Oh, wow, would you look at me? It's like I'm fresh out 
    of the box! Look at this 
    stitching! Andy's gonna have a hard time ripping this! 
    Hello! H-hi! Hello! 
J: Great. Now you can go. 
W: Well, what a good idea. 
P: Woody, don't be mad at Jessie. She's been through more 
    than you know. Why not make amends before you leave, 
    huh? It's the least you can do. 
W: All right. But I don't know what good it'll do. Hey. 
    Whatcha doing way up here? 
J: Thought I'd get one last look at the sun before I got 
    packed away again. 
W: Look, Jessie, I know you hate me for leaving, but I 
    have to go back. I'm still Andy's toy. Well, if you 
    knew him, you'd understand. 
    See, Andy's a real -- 
J: Let me guess. Andy's a real special kid. And to him, 
    you're his buddy, his best friend. And when Andy plays 
    with you, it's like even though you're not moving, 
    you feel like you're alive, because that's how he sees you. 
W: How did you know that? 
J: Because Emily was just the same. She was my whole world. 
When somebody loved me 
Everything was beautiful 
Every hour we spent together 
Lives within my heart 
And when she was sad 
I was there to dry her tears 
And when she was happy so was I 
When she loved me 
Through the summer and the fall 
We had each other 
That was all 
Just she and I together 
Like it was meant to be 
And when she was lonely 
I was there to comfort her 
And I knew that 
She loved me 
So the years went by 
I stayed the same 
But she began to drift away 
I was left alone 
Still I waited for the day 
When she'd say 
I will always love you 
Lonely and forgotten 
I never thought she'd look my way 
She smiled at me and held me 
Just like she used to do 
Like she loved me 
When she loved me 
When somebody loved me 
Everything was beautiful 
Every hour we spent together 
Lives within my heart 
When she loved me 
You never forget kids like Emily or Andy but they 
    forget you. 
W: Jessie, I -- I didn't know. 
J: Just go.
P: How long will it last, Woody? Do you really think 
    Andy is gonna take you to college or on his honeymoon? 
    Andy's growing up, and there's nothing you can do 
    about it. It's your choice, Woody. You can go back, 
    or you can stay with us and last forever. You'll be 
    adored by children for generations. 
W: Who am I to break up the Roundup gang? 
H: Hey, Woody, are you in here? 
PH: Nah, this one's empty too. 
S: Woody! Woody! 
H: Woody! 
S: Pardon me, gentlemen, but have either of you seen a 
    cowboy doll with a bad arm? 
Blue Robot: Why, no, I haven't. 
Red Robot: Hey! He was talkin' to me! 
Blue: No! He was talkin' to me! 
Red: Why, you -- 
R: You see, all along we thought the way into Zurg's 
    fortress was through the main gate, but in fact, 
    the secret entrance is to the left, hidden in 
    the shadows. 
UB: To the left and in the shadows. Got it. 
S: Someone's coming. 
UB: Everyone take cover. 
Al: It was a big pileup, but I don't want to bore 
    you with the details. Yes. Now let me confirm 
    your fax number. 
Konishi: 011-- 
Al: 011. Wait. That's a lot of numbers. No, I got it. 
S: It's him. 
H: The chicken man. 
UB: Funny, he doesn't look like poultry. 
S: That's the kidnapper, all right. 
UB: A kidnapper! An agent of Zurg if I ever saw one. 
Al: And the piece de resistance! I promise the 
    collection will be the town jewel of your museum. 
S: It's Woody! 
Al: Now that I have your attention, imagine we added 
    another zero to the price, huh? 
Konishi: I'll pay anything you want. 
Al: Yes! Yes! You got a deal! I'll be on the next 
    flight to Japan! 
UB: Quick, into the poultry man's cargo unit. He'll 
    lead us to Zurg. Move, move, move! 
Al: Don't touch my moustache! Rich, rich, rich, rich! 
B: Huh? 
Zurg (Z): Destroy Buzz Lightyear. Destroy Buzz Lightyear. 
    Destroy Buzz Lightyear. 
R: Aah! He didn't take the bag! 
UB: No time to lose! He's ascending in the vertical 
    transporter. All right, everyone. Hang on. We're 
    gonna blast through the roof. 
R: Uh, Buzz? 
UB: To infinity and beyond! 
PH: What are you? Insane? We're wasting time. Stand 
    still, Godzilla. 
UB: I don't understand. Somehow, my fuel cells have 
    gone dry. Blast. He's on level twenty three. 
S: How are we gonna get up there? 
R: Maybe if we find some balloons, we could float 
    to the top. 
PH: Are you kidding? I say we stack ourselves up, 
    push the intercom, and pretend we're delivering 
    a pizza. 
H: How about a ham sandwich...with fries and a hot dog? 
R: What about me? 
H: You can be the toy that comes with the meal. 
UB: Troops! Over here! Just like you said, lizard man, 
    'in the shadows to the left.' Okay, let's move! 
    Mission log. Have infiltrated enemy territory without 
    detection and are making our way through the bowels 
    of Zurg's fortress. 
H: You know, I think that Buzz aisle went to his head. 
S: Oh, no. Which way do we go? 
UB: This way! 
PH: What makes you so sure? 
UB: I'm Buzz Lightyear, I'm always sure! We've been 
    detected. The walls! They're closing in! Quick! 
    Help me prop up vegetable man or we're done for. 
PH: Hey! Put me down, you moron! 
R: Guys, look! It's not the walls! It's the elevator! 
UB: Come on. We've got no time to lose. Everyone grab hold! 
H: What? 
S: Huh? 
H: Uh, Buzz, why not just take the elevator? 
UB: They'll be expecting that. 
R: Hey, Buzz! Stop! Slow down! 
Al: To overnight six packages to Japan is how much? 
    What? That's in yen, right? Dollars? You are 
    deliberately taking advantage of people in a hurry, 
    you know that? All right! I'll do it! All right. 
    Fine. I'll have the stuff waiting in the lobby, and 
    you'd better be here in fifteen minutes because 
    I have a plane to catch, do you hear me? 
J: Whoo-hoo! We're finally going! Can you believe it? 
P: That's custom-fitted foam insulation you'll be 
    riding in, Bullseye. First class all the way! 
W: You know what? I'm actually excited about this. 
    I mean it. I really am! 
P: And why shouldn't you be? 
J: Yee-hah! 
W: Whoa! 
J: Swing your partner do-si-do! Look at you, you 
    dancing cowboy! 
P: Look! I'm doing the box step! 
H: Uh-oh. Hey, heads up down there! 
S: Whoa! Pork bellies are falling. 
PH: Hey, how much farther, Buzz? 
UB: Halfway there. 
R: My arms can't hold on much longer! 
UB: Too...heavy. Oh! What was I thinking? 
    My anti-gravity servos! Hang tight, everyone, 
    I'm going to let go of the wall. 
R: What? 
PH: He wouldn't. 
UB: One -- 
H: He would. 
UB: Two -- 
Toys: :rotest:: 
UB: Three! To infinity and beyond! Approaching destination. 
    Reengaging gravity. Area secure. It's okay, troops. 
    The antigravity sickness will wear off momentarily. 
    Now let's move! 
PH: Remind me to glue his helmet shut when we get back. 
W: How 'bout giving me a little intro there, Jessie? 
J: Introducing the high-riding-est cowboy around -- 
W: You forgot rootin'-tootin'-est! 
J: The high-ridin'-est, rootin'-tootin'-est cowboy hero 
    of all time, Sheriff Woody! 
W: Say, little missy, you notice any trouble around these parts? 
J: Nary a bit, not with Sheriff Woody around. 
W: Wait -- wait -- wait -- wait -- wait! I got it! 
    I got it! This is great! Okay! The bandits got the 
    critters tied up in the burning barn and now for the 
    best part! Help us! The barn's on fire! I've got ya, 
    critters.  No need to worry. Woody saves the day again! 
J: Yee-hah! 
W: Now, where's my trusty steed Bullseye? I have to ride 
    off into the sunset -- oh! Ride like the wind, Bullseye! 
    W--w--watch it. Wait, I'm ticklish, okay? 
J: Oh, you are? 
W: No, no, no. Cut it out. Stop it. Stop it. No please. 
    No, no. Stop! Stop! 
UB: Mission log. Have reached Zurg's command deck, but no 
    sign of him or his wooden captive. 
W: Please, no! 
S: That's Woody! 
UB: This way! 
W: Please, please no! 
PH: Buzz, can you see? What's going on? 
J: Take that! 
PH: To the left. No, your left. Take it up higher. 
UB: What's happening? Oh, it -- it's horrible. They -- 
    they're torturing him. 
R: What are we gonna do, Buzz? 
UB: Use your head! 
R: But I don't wanna use my head! 
P: What's going on here? 
W: Buzz, guys! Hey, how did you find me? 
UB: Watch yourself! 
S: We're here to spring ya, Woody! 
H: You heard of kung fu? Well, get ready for pork chop. 
PH: Prepare to meet Mr. Angry Eyes! 
W: Hold it, now! Hey, you don't understand! 
    These are my friends! 
R: Yeah, we're his friends! 
W: No, Rex, I mean they're my friends. 
J: Hey, stop it! Leave him alone, springy dog! Hey! 
S: Grab Woody and let's go! 
W: Fellas, hold it! Buzz, put me down! 
R: Quick! To the vent! 
J: They're stealing him! 
P: No!
B: Hold it right there! 
All: Buzz? 
UB: You again? 
B: Woody! Thank goodness you're all right. 
W: Buzz, what is going on? 
UB: Hold on. I am Buzz Lightyear, and I'm in charge 
    of this detachment. 
B: No, I'm Buzz Lightyear. 
UB: I'm Buzz Lightyear. 
B: I am Buzz Lightyear! 
W: So, who's the real Buzz? 
B & UB: I am! 
UB: Don't let this imposter fool you! 
    He's been trained by Zurg 
    himself to mimic my every move. 
All: Buzz! 
S: I had a feeling it was you, Buzz. My front end just 
    had to catch up with my back end. 
UB: Will somebody please explain what's going on? 
B: It's all right, space ranger. It's a code 546. 
UB: You mean it's a -- 
B: Yes. 
UB: And he's a -- 
B: Oh, yeah. 
UB: Your Majesty. 
B: Woody, you're in danger here. We need to leave now. 
R: Al's selling you to a toy museum in Japan! 
W: I know, it's okay, Buzz. I actually wanna go. 
R: What? 
H: Are you crazy? 
W: Look, the thing is, I'm a rare Sheriff Woody doll, 
    and these guys are my Roundup gang. 
B: Woody, what are you talking about? 
W: What am I talking about? Woody's Roundup! Oh, 
    it's this great old TV show and I was the star. 
    See? Now look. Look! Look at me! See? That's me! 
H: This is weirding me out. 
W: Buzz, it was a national phenomenon. There was all 
    this merchandise that just got packed up. Oh, 
    you should have seen it. There was a record player 
    and a yo-yo -- Buzz, I was a yo-yo! 
PH: Was? 
B: Woody, stop this nonsense and let's go. 
W: Nah, Buzz. I can't go. I can't abandon these guys. 
    They need me to get into this museum. Without me, 
    they'll go back into storage -- maybe forever! 
B: Woody, you're not a collector's item. You are a 
    child's plaything. You are a toy! 
W: For how much longer? One more rip, and Andy's done 
    with me. And what do I do then, Buzz? Huh? You 
    tell me. 
B: Somewhere in that pad of stuffing is a toy who 
    taught me that life's only worth living if 
    you're being loved by a kid. And I travelled all 
    this way to rescue that toy because I believed 
    him. 
W: Well, you wasted your time. 
B: Let's go, everyone. 
S: What about Woody? 
B: He's not coming with us. 
R: But -- but Andy's coming home tonight. 
B: Then we'd better make sure we're there waiting 
    for him. 
W: I don't have a choice, Buzz. This is my only 
    chance. 
B: To do what, Woody? Watch kids from behind glass 
    and never be loved again? Some life. 
W (TV): Is everbody okay? 
J (TV): Sheriff Woody! I knew you'd make it! 
W (TV): Now, remember, deputies, the real treasures 
    are your friends and family. Before I go, kids, 
    I want to share something special with you for 
    the times when I'm not around. 
P: Good going, Woody! I thought they'd never leave. 
W (TV): You've got a friend in me 
You've got a friend in me. 
P: Woody? 
W (TV): You've got troubles 
Well, I've got 'em, too 
There isn't anything 
I wouldn't do for you 
We stick together and 
See it through 
'Cause you got a friend in me. 
Some other folks might be 
A little bit smarter than I am 
Bigger and stronger too 
Maybe 
But none of them will ever love you 
The way I do 
It's me and you, boy. 
And as the years go by 
Our friendship will never die 
W: What am I doing? 
W (TV): You're gonna see it's our destiny 
W: Buzz! Wait! Wait! 
P: Woody, where are you going? 
W: You're right, Prospector, I can't stop Andy 
    from growing up. But I wouldn't miss it 
    for the world. 
P: No! 
W: Buzz! 
B: Yes? 
UB: Yes? 
W: I'm coming with you! Wait -- wait -- wait 
    -- wait. I'll be back in just a second. 
B: Way to go, cowboy! 
W: Hey, you guys, come with me. 
J: What? 
W: Andy will play with all of us. I know it! 
J: Woody, I -- I -- I don't know -- I -- 
W: Wouldn't you give anything just to have 
    one more day with Emily? Come on, Jessie. 
    This is what it's all about : to make a 
    child happy. And you know it. Bullseye, 
    are you with me? Okay, good boy. 
    Prospector, how 'bout you? 
J: Prospector! 
W: You're outta your box! 
P: I tried reasoning with you, Woody, but you 
    kept forcing me to take extreme measures. 
W: Wait a minute. You turned on the TV last 
    night, not Jessie. 
P: Look, we have an eternity to spend together 
    in the museum. Let's not start by pointing 
    fingers, shall we? 
W: You really are Stinky Pete, aren't you? 
J: Prospector, this isn't fair! 
P: Fair? I'll tell you what's not fair! 
    Spending a lifetime on a dime-store shelf 
    watching every other toy be sold. Well, 
    finally my waiting has paid off and 
    no hand-me-down cowboy doll is gonna mess 
    it up for me now! 
W: Buzz. Help, Buzz! Guys! 
P: It's too late, Woody. That silly Buzz 
    Lightweight can't help you. 
W: His name is Buzz Lightyear! 
P: Whatever. I've always hated those upstart 
    space toys. 
W: It's stuck! What do we do? 
R: Should I use my head? 
W: It's Al! 
Al: Look at the time. I'm gonna be late! Oh, 
    figures. I can't miss this flight! 
    I've gotta pack. All right. Let's see. 
    Uh, wallet, keys, tickets, uh, passport, 
    beef jerky -- very expensive over there. 
    Shower! Oh, I can skip the shower. 
    I just gotta get outta here now! 
B: Quick! To the elevator! Hurry, I can hear 
    it coming. 
Z: So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear -- 
    for the last time. 
R: Aah! 
R & UB: It's Zurg! 
R: Watch out! He's got an ion blaster! 
B: Quick! Get on! The emergency hatch! 
    Come on! Come on! Hurry! 
R: But Buzz is in peril! 
UB's voicebox: Buzz -- Buzz -- Buzz 
    Lightyear to the rescue! 
Z: Surrender, Buzz Lightyear. I have won. 
UB: I'll never give in. You killed my father! 
Z: No, Buzz. I am your father. 
UB: Nooooooooo! 
Al: Come on! Come on! Come on! 
R: Buzz, you could have defeated Zurg all 
    along! You just need to believe in yourself! 
Z: Prepare to die. 
R: I can't look! 
Z: Wh -- wh -- whoa! 
R: I did it. I finally defeated Zurg! 
UB: Father. 
Al: Ah, finally! 
R: How are we gonna get him now? 
PH: Pizza, anyone? 
B: Go, go, go! 
UB: I got it! 
B: Buzz, are you coming? 
UB: No, I have a lot of catching up to do with my dad. 
Z: Good throw, son. That's my boy. Go long, Buzzy! 
UB: Oh, you're a great dad. Yippee! 
B: Farewell. 
R: Does anyone know how to drive? 
B: Slink, take the pedals. Rex, you navigate. 
    Hamm and Potato, operate the levers and knobs. 
S: Whoa. 
Squeeze Toy Aliens (ST): Ooooooooooh. 
ST 1: Strangers. 
ST 2: From the outside. 
B: Oh, no. 
R: He's at a red light! We can catch him! 
B: Maximum power, Slink! 
R: Waaa! It turned green! Hurry! 
B: Why won't it go? 
STs: Use the wand of power. 
H: Oh! Ow! Ooh! 
B: Rex, which way? 
R: Left! No, no! I mean right! That's right! 
    No, I mean left! Left is right! 
    Buzz, he's turning left! He's turning left! 
STs: Oh, oh, boy! Whoa - oa - oa - oa! 
H: Oh, I seriously doubt he's getting this 
    kind of mileage. 
R: Go right! To the right! Right -- right 
    -- right -- right! 
STs: Whoa! You have saved our lives. We 
    are eternally grateful. 
PH: Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. 
PA: The white zone is for immediate loading 
    and unloading. No parking. 
R: Guys, we can't park here! It's a white 
    zone! 
STs: You have saved our lives. We are 
    eternally grateful. 
PA: Final boarding call for Far East Airlines... 
B: There he is! 
PA: ...flight 451 to Tokyo, all confirmed 
    passengers must board at this time. 
    Passenger Twitch, passenger Leon Twitch, 
    please pick up -- 
STs: You have saved our lives! We are 
    eternally grateful! 
PH: Will you just leave me alone? 
R: Oh! Someone's coming! 
Girl: Ooh, a puppy! 
S: Uh, bark-bark-bark-bark, bark-bark-bark-bark. 
Al: Listen, flyboy, the contents of that 
    case are worth more than you make in a year! 
    You got that, sport! You be careful! 
Clerk: I understand, sir. 
Al: Do you have a fragile sticker or something? 
Clerk: Don't worry, sir. 
Al: Because I know what goes on back there, 
    I had a box of cookies once that 
    came back as crumbs! 
ST: The Mystic Portal! 
STs: Oooooooh! 
B: Once we go through, we just need to find 
    that case. 
S: Ow! There's the case! 
H: No, there's the case! 
B: You take that one! We'll take this one! 
S: Whoa-oa! Buzz! Buzz, my back end's going 
    to Baton Rouge! 
B: Slinky! 
H: Here we come, Woody! 
PH: Woody, here we come! 
R: Woody! 
H: Nice flash though. 
B: Okay, Woody, let's go! 
P: Take that, space toy. 
W: Hey! No one does that to my friend! 
P: Your choice, Woody. You can go to Japan 
    together or in pieces. If he fixed ya once, 
    he can fix ya again. Now get in the box! 
W: Never! 
P: Fine! No! Aah! 
B: Gotcha! 
P: Idiots! Children destroy toys! You'll all be 
    ruined, forgotten! Spending eternity 
    rotting in some landfill! 
W: Well, Stinky Pete, I think it's time you 
    learned the true meaning of playtime. 
    Right over there, guys! 
P: No. No! No! 
PA: Atlantic Air flight eight is now arriving 
    at... 
Amy: Look, Barbie, a big ugly man doll! 
    Ooh, he needs a makeover.

Mother: Come on, hon!
W: Happy trails, Prospector. 
S: Buzz! Woody! 
H: Help us out here! 
R: Hurry! 
W: Oh, no, Jessie! Come on! 
J: Oh, Woody! 
W: Jessie! Yah! Ride like the wind, Bullseye! 
    Hey, howdy, hey! Giddyap! 
B: Come on, Bullseye! Yah! 
W: Buzz, give me a boost! Oh! Ohhh! Ohhh! 
B: Woody! 
Worker: Here's the rest! 
W: Ah! Excuse me, ma'am, but I believe you're 
    on the wrong flight. 
J: Woody! 
W: Come on, Jess. It's time to take you home. 
J: But what if Andy doesn't like me? 
W: Nonsense! Andy'll love you! Besides, 
    he's got a little sister. 
J: He does? Why didn't you say so? Let's go! 
W: Whoa! 
Worker: Hold it! There's a couple more bags 
    coming from the terminal! 
W: Okay. On three. One, two -- 
Worker: Too late! Put 'em on the next flight! 
W: This is bad. 
J: How are we gonna get outta here? 
W: Over there! Come on! 
J: You sure about this? 
W: No! Let's go! 
J: Hold on, Woody! 
B: What's a cowboy without his hat? 
W: Buzz! Buzz! Buzz, get behind the tires! 
    Jessie, let go of the plane! 
J: What? Are you crazy? 
W: Just pretend it's the final episode of 
    Woody's Roundup. 
J: But it was cancelled! We never saw if 
    you made it! 
W: Well, then, let's find out together! 
    Oh-oh-oh! 
J: We did it! We did it! 
B: Nice ropin', cowboy. 
J: That was definately Woody's finest hour! 
B: Your hat, partner. 
W: Hoo-hoo! Let's...go home. 
A: Yee-hah! Hey, Woody! Woody? Oh, wow! 
    New toys! Cool! Thanks, Mom! It's Bazooka 
    Jane and her jet-propelled horse! Woody, 
    Buzz, that polecat Zurg has stolen my 
    space cows! 
AM: Andy, come on hon. Time to go. Hey, 
    you fixed Woody! 
A: Yeah. Glad I decided not to take him to camp. 
    His whole arm might have come off. 
W: Well, what do you know? 
J: Yee-hah! Oh, Bullseye, we're part of a 
    family again! 
Bullseye: Hmm? 
B: Uh, m--ma'am, I, uh -- well, I just wanted 
    to say you're a bright young woman with a 
    beautiful yarnful of hair. Uh, a hairful 
    of yarn. It's uh -- whoo -- uh -- I must go. 
J: Well, aren't you the sweetest space toy I 
    ever met? 
S: What's that? Bark bark? This fella says he 
    needs to go out back for a little private 
    time. 
J: That critter needs help! Yodel-ay-hee-hoo! 
H: Ooh, ooh, oh -- hey, Rex, I could use a hand 
    over here, buddy. 
R: I don't need to play! I've lived it! 
H: No-no-no-no! Oh, nuts! 
Al: Welcome to Al's Toy Barn. We've got the 
    lowest prices in town. Everything for a 
    buck-buck-buck. 
H: Well, I guess crime doesn't pay. 
W: Oh, Andy did a great job, huh? Nice and 
    strong! 
BP: I like it. Makes you look...tough. 
STs: You have saved our lives. We are eternally 
    grateful. 
MPH: You saved their lives? Oh, my hero! And 
    they're so adorable! Let's adopt them! 
STs: Daddy! 
PH: Oh, no. 
W: Wheezy, you're fixed! 
Wh: Oh, yeah, Mr. Shark looked in the toybox 
    and found me an extra squeaker. 
W: And how do you feel? 
Wh: Oh, I feel swell. In fact, I think I feel 
    a song coming on. 
You've got a friend in me 
You've got a friend in me 
You just remember what your old pal said 
Babe, you've got a friend in me 
Yeah, you've got a friend in me 
AM: Come on over. Oh, you are such a big girl. 
    Andy, you think she's ready to drive the 
    car yet? 
A: Yeah, and I can teach her. 
B: You still worried? 
W: About Andy? Nah, it'll be fun while it lasts. 
B: I'm proud of you, cowboy. 
W: Besides, when it all ends, I'll have old Buzz 
    Lightyear to keep me company for infinity and 
    beyond. 
Wh & Barbies: You're gonna see it's our destiny 
You got a friend in me 
Barbies: Yes, you do 
Wh & Barbies: You've got a friend in me 
Barbies: That's the truth 
Wh & Barbies: You've got a friend in me 
Wh: Yeah! 

Crew: Speed. Marker. Action. 
W: Oh! Okay. A little help here, please. 
R: What are we gonna do, Buzz? 
UB: Use your head. 
R: But I don't wanna use my head! Ow! 
Crew: Speed. Marker. Take ten. Pull back. 
B: Whew! I don't remember eating that. 
Crew: Cut! 
Other Buzz: I can't believe it. That's the 
    fifth time. What row is that guy in? 
B: Sorry, everyone. I had that bean burrito 
    for lunch. Okay, I'm all right now. Sorry. 
Crew: And action. 
MPH: I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes 
    and your angry eyes, just in case. And 
    if you get hungry, here's some cheese 
    puffs. And a key. I don't know what 
    it's for, but you never know. 
Crew: Speed. Marker. And action. 
J: Whoo! Could this -- should that just be 
    part of the movie now? He lost -- he 
    lost his string! 
MPH: And a golf ball if you have time for 
    golf. And a plastic steak and a rubber 
    ducky and a yo-yo. 
B: Who's behind? 
S: Mine. 
Crew: All right, cut, good take. 
S: What good acting. That was a good take. 
    You're such a cute little bottom. 
    Look at you, look at you, look at you. 
Wh: In fact, I think I feel a song coming on. 
    Mr. Mike, I'm so sorry. Did I hurt your 
    equipment? Oh, you gotta aim it right 
    here at my flipper. I'm not a very good 
    catch. Okay. Yeah. I'm ready for another 
    take. 
Crew: Let's go again. 
Wh: Oh, no! I think I swallowed my squeaker. 
MPH:And an extra bouncy bouncy ball and some 
    extra teeth. Be careful. They chatter. 
PH: Whoa! 
Crew: Marker. And action. 
B: We'll be back before Andy gets home. What? 
    What are you laughing about? Huh? Ha ha ha! 
    Real funny, Woody. 
Crew: All right, we're losing our light. 
    Wipe it off and let's go again. 
S: Golly bob howdy! 
B: What? What's so funny? Woody! Huh? 
    Darn it, Woody! 
Crew: Okay, let's go again. 
MPH: And crayons, in case you get bored. 
    And some blue Play-Doh. 
Flik: Isn't this exciting, Heimlich? 
    Our first day of shooting. 
Heimlich: Oh, ja, ja, it's so exciting. 
Flik: I can't believe that you talked them 
    into making A Bug's Life 2. 
Heimlich: Oh, ja, I can hardly believe it also. 
    But there's a little baby tiny thing I 
    forgot to tell you. 
Flik: What's that, Heimlich? 
Heimlich: Well, you know, it's a two movie, 
    but it's not A Bug's Life 2. 
Flik: Well, then, I -- don't understand. 
    What is it then? 
Crew: Marker. Action. 
W: Bullseye, are you with me? Okay, good boy. 
    Prospector, how about you? 
P: And so you two are absolutely identical? 
    You know, I'm sure I can get you a part 
    in Toy Story 3. I'm sorry. Are we back? 
    Oh! All right, girls. Lovely talking 
    with you. Yes, anytime you'd like some 
    tips on acting, I'd be glad to chat with 
    you. All right, off you go then. 
Crew: Speed. Wait, wait, let me check focus. 
ST1: So, did you make it into the first 
    Toy Story? 
ST2: Well, if you look at the letterbox copy, 
    you can see my arm grabbing Woody's ankle. 
ST3: What are you gonna do next? 
ST2: Well, I'm up for this job in a toothpaste 
    commercial. 
ST1: Wow. That's great. 
ST3: Really? 
MPH: And a dime. Call me. And monkey chow. 
PH: Monkey chow? For what? 
MPH: Well, for the monkeys, of course! 
    Come on, monkeys! 
PH: That's it. I draw the line at monkeys. 
    Get my agent on the phone! 
Crew: Marker. And action. 
P: It's your choice, Woody. You can go back, 
    or you can stay with us and last forever. 
    Good heavens! Was that me? Oh! Oh, my! 
    I am so sorry. I guess that's why they 
    call me Stinky Pete. Whew! 
Crew: Okay, let's cut. 
TGB: We are so glad you came. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. 
    Bye-bye. Bye-bye now. Bye. Bye-bye. Remember, 
    please discard all candy wrappers and popcorn 
    containers in the nearest trash receptacle. 
    Thank you. Okay, bye-bye now. Bye-bye. Bye. 
    Okay. Are they all gone? Is every -- is 
    everybody gone? Huh? Good. Oh, my gosh, 
    my cheeks are killing me. I can't keep smiling 
    like this anymore. I am exhausted. I think 
    I need a break. A little break? Okay. Whew!
