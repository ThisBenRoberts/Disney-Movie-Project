Big Mama	Yeah, that�s a good idea!
Dinky	Okay, Boomer, now you know what to do.
Boomer	Yeah! Leave it to me! Leave it to me!
Widow Tweed	Who is it? Um. Well I was sure I heard someone knocking gasps Oh dear! My laundry! Big Mama and Dinky are taking away the laundry and so the woman, running after them could find the fox cub Oh here! Stop it! Oh you pesky birds. Will you come back here? Oh! Stop!

You know, Tod, I�m not going to be so lonesome any more.
That day, Amos, her neighbour and a bad tempered hunter, brings with him a beautiful hound puppy called Copper, to learn from Chief, another dog, how to hunt.
Amos Slade	I got a surprise for you, Chief, old boy, heh-heh Chief receives his master barking Now, now, now, take it easy he shows a sack from which we hear someone whimpering: it�s a puppy Well, how�s this for a huntin� dog? He�s just a little runt now, but he�ll grow. May as well get used to him, Chief. He�s for you to look after from now on. Copper wants to play with Chief, and finally they sleep together
Widow Tweed�s farm. She�s milking her cow, Abigail, but Tod wants to play� and something more.
Widow Tweed	Tod, stop pestering Abigail. Abigail, you�re going to have to be patient with Tod, He�s one of the family now. Tod attracts lady�s attention Of course. Now I know. I declare, I never will get my chores done Tod tries to play with the chicks but the hen thinks he�s going to harm them and also Abigail is scared Oh! Mercy! Tod! Stop it! Abigail! Abigail!

Now don�t try to butter me up but he does Oh Tod, I just can�t stay angry with you. You little imp. Now, run along and play. Go on, and try to stay out of mischief.
Tod feels himself lonely because he has nobody to play with. Then he sees Dinky and Boomer
Tod	Hey, it�s Dinky and Boomer. Maybe they wanna play.
Dinky	Is this it, Boomer?
Boomer	Oh sure, Dinky. This is the place I never forget a tree. I never forget a tree laughs
Dinky	He won�t get away this time laughs Hold it, Boomer. I think I hear somethin�.

Dinky	Now see what you done? You cost us our breakfast.

Dinky	What are you talkin� my fault?
Boomer	Yeah.
Dinky	Aw no-You were the one who let him�
Tod	A worm? For breakfast? Yuk! Blah! he leaves
Tod enjoys himself very much with the gently woman keeping her company and behaving as a �naughty� toddler.

One day, Copper smells something different that happens to be Tod himself.
Chief	Hey, there, Copper, what you sniffin� at?
Copper	Something� I never smelled before, Chief.
Chief	Huh! Let me see he tries Ah, shucks, that�s easy. The master�s just a-cookin� grits and fatback. You ougtha know that.
Copper	Mm-mmm. That�s not what I smell he follows the trail into the forest where he meets Tod I don�t know Chief, it�s something else.
Chief	Ha-ha! Sonny, you got a lot of learnin� to do about a-sniffing and a-smellin�. Hmm. Hey, where you goin�?
Copper	I want to find out what that smell is.
Chief	Okay Copper, but the master ain�t gonna like you wandering off.
Copper	I won�t get lost, Chief. I can smell my way back.
Chief	Humph. Can�t tell these young whippersnappers anything.
In the forest. Tod sees how Copper follows a trail, but he doesn�t know what is it.
Tod	Watcha smellin�?
Copper	I�m on the hail of something.
Tod	Trail of what?
Copper	I don�t know yet he smells Tod Why, it�s� it�s you! howling
Tod	What do you that for?
Copper	We�re supposed to do that when we find what we�ve been trackin�.
Tod	I�m a fox. My name�s Tod. That�s your name kid?
Copper	Mine�s Copper. I�m a hound dog.
Tod	Gee, I bet you�d be good playing hide a seek. You wanna try it, Copper?
Copper	Can I use my nose?
Tod	laughing Sure, okay. Now go ahead and close your eyes and count.
Copper	One, two, three he looks for Tod before time
Tod	No Copper! You can�t peek!
Copper	Oh!
Tod	Now start again.
Copper	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven�
Big Mama	She�s witness of this friendship My, my. Look at that. A fox and a hound playin� together.

When you're the best of friends
having so much fun together
you're not even aware
you're such a funny pair
you're the best of friends

Life's a happy game
you could clown around forever
neither one of you sees
your natural boundaries
life's one happy game
Amos Slade	from the distance and whistling Copper!
Copper	Gee, I gotta go.
Big Mama	If only the world
wouldn't get in the way
if only people
just let you play
they say you're both
being fools
you're breaking all the rules
they can't understand
the magic of your wonderland

When you're the best of friends
Tod	Copper!
Big Mama	sharing all that you discover
when these moments have passed
will that friendship last
who can say
if there's a way
Oh, I hope
I hope it never ends
Tod	Come on, Copper!
Big Mama	'cause you're the best of friends
Tod	Copper, you�re my very best friend.
Copper	And you�re mine too, Tod.
Tod	And we�ll always be friends, forever, won�t we?
Copper	Yeah, forever.
Tod	Hey, let�s go swimming!
Copper	Give a head start and I can beat ya.
Big Mama	Whoo!
Amos Slade	Dognabit, that Copper pup�s gone and strayed off again. Come on, Chief, If�n that little rascal�s gonna make me a good huntin� dog he�s gonna learn to mind whistling Copper! Get over here! whistling Copper!
Copper	Uh-oh! I gotta go home.
Tod	Do ya have to? We�re having too much fun.
Copper	I gotta. He sounds awful mad.
Tod	I�ll see ya tomorrow. And don�t forget!
Copper	running to home I won�t.
Copper is bawled out for having run off and the following day is tied up to his barrel. When he fails to appear in the forest Tod goes to find him.
Tod	Hey Copper, what happened to ya? Why didn�t you� Golly! You�re all tied up.
Copper	Yeah, and it�s no fun either. The master says I gotta stay home.
Tod	Well, we can play around here then laughs
Copper	No, no. Not with old Chief over there.
Tod	Chief�s snoring Is that him making that awful noise?
Copper	He keeps awake at night Tod approaches to Chief Oh don�t in there. He can get awful mean. He�s cranky.
Tod	Gee whillikiers is he ever big. His ears isn�t as big as yours Copper.
Copper	That�s not the part you gotta worry about.
Tod	Wow! Look at those teeth.
Copper	That�s the part you gotta worry about.
Chief	dreaming I�m gainin� on him. He won�t get away now.
Copper	He�s having a dream. He�s chasin� somethin�.
Chief	When I get him cornered� laughing Ah, it�s� it�s� it�s a big old badger.
Tod	Copper! He�s chasin� a badger chuckling
Chief	No, no. It ain�t a badger. It�s a� it�s a� sniffing Tod it�s a fox. A fox? He awakes and dragging his barrel behind him gives snarling chase
Copper	Run, Tod, run. Tod runs in terror into the chicken yard and all the squawking and barking rouse the hunter
Tod leaps aboard Widow Tweed�s fortuitously passing truck just in time to avoid being blasted with shotgun pellets
Widow Tweed	Tod! Amos Slade, you trigger-happy lunatic! Give me that gun! she shoots to his car
Amos Slade	My radiator! Why, you blasted female! I�ll� I�ll�
Widow Tweed	Hold it right there!
Amos Slade	Watch it. That thing�s loaded.
Widow Tweed	She shoots to the air Now it ain�t loaded.
Amos Slade	Dognabit, woman, your thievin� fox was after my chickens.
Widow Tweed	Rubbish and poppycock! I don�t believe it. He wouldn�t hurt a thing.
Amos Slade	You callin� me a liar, you muddle-headed female? I saw it happen!
Widow Tweed	Amos Slade, that temper of yours is going to get you into a lot of trouble someday.
Amos Slade	Temper? Temper! Woman, you ain�t seen my temper! If I ever catch that fox on my property again, I�ll blast him. And next time, I won�t miss.
From that moment Tod must stay at home.
Widow Tweed	Poor little tyke. It�s a shame I have to keep him cooped up. Oh-ho. Tod, stop looking at me like that. It�s not my fault, you know. You caused a lot of trouble yesterday Tod hears a dog barking Oh, now, what are they up to? Huh! Why, it looks like Amos is going on a hunting trip. A long one, from the looks of it. Hmmm. Well, good riddance Tod escapes by the window without been seen
Amos Slade	Doggone meddlin� female, shootin� up my radiator. Dad blame it, get goin�. Well, that�s more like it. Keep runnin�, old girl. Well Copper, me and old Chief are gonna teach you all about huntin�, yes sir. It�s about time, too. Atta boy laughing Yeah, you�re really gonna like trackin� down those varmints for me.
Chief	Copper sits in the truck with him Uh-uh. Get in the back, half pint. You gotta earn your right to sit up front.
Amos Slade	Well boys, we�re getting� outta here �til next spring Copper howls from the truck saying goodbye to Tod, who�s there watching the scene
Big Mama	Tod, honey, what are you doin� over here?
Tod	Gee, I just wanted to say goodbye to Copper, but I�m too late He�s disappointed
Big Mama	Well, what did you plan to do if you ran into old Chief?
Tod	Aw, Chief. I can outfox that dumb old dog anytime.
Big Mama	Tod, now hold it just a minute. Didn�t you learn anything yesterday? Now you listen good, Tod, because it�s either education or elimination. Now if you�re so foxy and old Chief�s so dumb then why does that hound get the fox on the run? �Cause he�s the hunter, and the hunter�s got the gun. Kabaam! Elimination. Lack of education.
If you pal around
With that Copper hound
You�ll wind up
Hangin� on the wall
Keep your nose to the wind
And you�ll keep your skin
�cause you won�t be home when
the hunter comes to call
Tod	Oh Big Mama, I know Copper would never track on me down. Why, Copper he�s my very best friend.
Big Mama	Ho-ho! Your best friend! Now Copper�s gonna do what he�s been told. Supposed to chase the little fox in the old fox hole. And along comes the hunter with a buckshot load.
Boomer	K-Kabaam!
Big Mama	Elimination
Dinky	Lack of education
Big Mama	You better believe it, Tod, yes siree!
Tod	You mean Copper is gonna be my enemy?
Dinky	Hey, kid, you better step over here and take a good look Boomer and Dinky opens a hut in which Amos puts his traps and some animals� skins
Tod	Why� why that�s awful. Those poor things.
Big Mama	I�m sorry Tod. Honey, Copper�s gonna come back as trained huntin� dog. A real killer.
Tod	Oh no, not my friend Copper. He won�t ever change.
Big Mama	I hope you�re right, Tod.
Tod	And we�ll keep on being friends forever. Uh, won�t we, Big Mama?
Big Mama	Darling, forever is a long, long time and time has a way of changin� things.
The seasons pass, autumn, winter� It�s a snowy winter and our old chap, the caterpillar has to find a warm place where he can live during this hard season. The best place is a plant which Widow Tweed has at home.
Dinky	Oh! OH Jimminy! It sure turned cold.
Boomer	Brrr, I�m freezin� my b-b-b�
Dinky	Hey! They are living in the scarecrow because they don�t have any nest in which they could spend the winter It�s that fuzzy worm. Let�s get him. Charge!
Boomer	Hey Dinky. Dinky, quick, over here. I got him. I got him!
Dinky	Do I look like a worm? That�s who we�re after. Come on! looking through the keyhole Look at that little creep, warm and cosy by the fire.
Boomer	Let me take a look. How do you like that g-g-guy? S-snug as a bug.
Caterpillar	Mmm.
Boomer	While we�re out here freezin� our b-b-beaks off.
Dinky	Oh, well, yackin� and shiverin� ain�t getting� us anywhere. We�ll get that no good worm when we come back.
Boomer	Oh� sh-shucks.
Dinky	So log, Big Mama.
Boomer	Yeah, we�re going south for the winter.
Big Mama	Goodbye boys! See ya next spring!
The winter is so long and Tod feels himself lonely. He miss so much his old friend Copper. There are the empty barrels in which Copper and Chief used to stay.
In another place, Amos and Chief are teaching Copper to be a good hound dog. Chief has taking good care of him, like a good old nurse. Copper grows up but he has to be trained: he wants only to play, it�s time to learn how to help the hunter. Soon we see how the hunter�s hat is going to be filled with animals� skins.
Spring again and Amos comes back to home; Big Mama cleans her nest of dried leaves; Tod� he is now a handsome adult fox.
Big Mama	She hears somebody laughing Well, look who�s here. Oh my goodness laughs I�m sorry, Tod, honey. I hope----
Dinky	Hiya, Big Mama. We�re back. We flew all the way.
Boomer	Yeah, we did, we did.
Big Mama	Welcome home boys! You know, it�s been kind of lonesome around here without you little rascals.
Tod	Hi, fellas!
Boomer	Hey, who�s that? Who�s that?
Dinky	Hey, this can�t be that scrawny little squirt we found by the fence post, can it? Come on.
Boomer	I-I-I can�t believe my eyes.
Tod	Ha, ha! Oh it�s me, all right.
Dinky	Hey, looky here. He�s got himself a real fancy collar.
Boomer	Hey, hey, hey. Just look at this bushy tail giggling B-b-beautiful everybody laughs
Tod	Aw, come on, cut it out. You guys are always teasin� me.
Widow Tweed appears with a dead plant in her hands: it�s the place where the caterpillar has spent the winter.
Dinky	Hey, it�s him! Squeeks! to Tod We�ll see ya later, kid. We gotta take care of some unfinished business.
Widow Tweed	I can�t understand. It was so healthy she waters it There. That ought to perk it up.
Boomer	Where�d he so? Where�d he go?
Dinky	echoing his voice He�s going up the drain pipe. I�ll head him off. Okay Boomer. We got him trapped. Let him have it.
Boomer	Did you get him?
Dinky	No, I didn�t.
Boomer	Neither did I.
Dinky	Come on, look!
Boomer	A caterpillar under glass gligging Oh boy! they receive an electric charge wheezing Holy---
Dinky	Smoke!
Boomer	Hey, hey, hey. How�s he do that Dinky? How�s he do that?
That day, Amos, Chief and Copper return home.
Amos Slade	I ain�t got no job
I�m hurting man
And I�d rather have
A dog than a dollar
So let�s go banjo
Ring-a-ling-a-ding ho
Give a little hoot
And a holler
Oh, come on, Chief. Just �cause you�re not sittin� up front, that ain�t no reason to be sorehead Copper licks Chief Shucks, if it weren�t for you, Copper�d never have turned into a good huntin� dog. Yes, siree. Now I got me the best two dogs there is. Right Copper? he howls Ha, ha, ha, isn�t the somethin� Chief? laughing Amos and Copper howl together
Tod	hearing them Look, Big Mama. Copper�s back. Huh, boy, has he grown big.
Big Mama	Uh-huh. And look at that big pile of skins he helped track down.
Tod	I know Big Mama, he�s a huntin� dog now.
Big Mama	You�re right. And you�re a fox.
Tod	Ah, that won�t make any difference. Copper�s gonna be glad to see me.
Big Mama	Well honey, just don�t get your hopes too high.
Tod	Look, don�t worry. I�ll be careful. I�ll go over tonight when Chief and the hunter are sound sleep.
Copper	Boy, it�s great to be back home, isn�t is, Chief?
Chief	Huh?
Copper	Aw, come on, Chief. You aren�t still sore, are you? Hey, hey, come on. Let�s scuffle. We ain�t scuffled in a long time. Come on, Chief. Let�s have some fun.
Chief	Oh, lay off Copper, you overgrown pup, you. Ha, ha, ha. Oh let go. Dognabit, let go, I say.
Copper	Oh okay, okay.
Chief	You know that was your trouble on the hunt.
Copper	Aw, come on, old timer. You treat me like a pup, you know that? Oh I think I done real good trackin� down them varmints for ya.
Chief	Smellin� and hackin� ain�t enough. You gotta think nasty. Heh!
Copper	Ohay, okay. I know. I know.

Night. Everybody sleeps but Copper hears leaves rusting.
Tod	Copper soft whistle Hey Copper. It�s me, Tod.
Copper	I thought that was you, Tod. I heard ya comin�. Boy you�ve really grown.
Tod	You have too, Copper. I saw you comin� back with Chief and the hunter.
Copper	It�s great to see ya, Tod. But ya know, you shouldn�t be over here. You�re gonna get us both into a lot of trouble.
Tod	Hey, look I--- I just wanted to see ya. We�re� we�re still friends, aren�t we?
Copper	doubting Tod, those days are over. I-I�m a huntin� dog now Tod�s disappointed Uh, you�d better get out of here before old Chief wakes up.
Tod	Aw, Chief. He doesn�t worry me.
Copper	Tod, I�m serious. You�re fair game� Chief is awaking as far as he�s concerned. Chief discovers Tod and gives the alarm
Amos Slade	It�s that fox again he fires
Widow Tweed	Oh no! No! They�re after Tod!
Amos Slade	After him, boys! Go git him!
Tod is persecuted by Amos and his dogs, but it�s Chief who has more interest on him. Tod hides in the railway but is found by Copper. The later let him escape after their old friendship
Amos Slade	Copper! Copper! Copper!
Copper	Tod, I� I don�t wanna see you to get killed.
Amos Slade	Tracked him down, boy!
Copper	I�ll let you go this one time so he runs in other direction howling
Amos Slade	Don�t lose him! Tod thinks he�s saved but he faces to Chief again. Amos hears Chief and goes where the old dog is. There they are! Old Chief�s got him on the run. We see how a train is coming. Tod can hide because of his size but not Chief who has to jump Jump, Chief, jump! The dog obeys but in the fall he breaks his leg
Copper	Chief! Chief? Oh no! Oh To Tod who�s watching from the railway Tod, if it�s the last thing I do, I�ll� I�ll get you for this!
Some time later, Widow Tweed finds Tod and they come back home
Widow Tweed	Tod! Tod? Tod! Oh Tod, thank heaven you�re safe!

Amos� house. He�s so angry and goes to Widow Tweed�s home. He wants to kill Tod.
Copper	Oh, poor Chief. It�s all my fault. I shouldn�t have let Tod go.
Dinky	Big Mama! Wake up! Wake up! There�s trouble.
Widow Tweed	Tod! Well what is it? Tod hides himself because he has heard Amos approaching What on Earth?
Amos Slade	Widow, get out here!
Widow Tweed	Why Amos! What are you�
Amos Slade	And where is he? Where is he? I know he�s in there.
Widow Tweed	Now, just a minute. You can�t come barging onto my property, Amos Slade! She slams the door
Amos Slade	That fox of yours almost killed Chief, and I�m gonna get him! You can�t keep him locked up forever!

Next day morning, Widow Tweed, sadly, looks an old photo of Tod�s birthday. She has to do a very hard thing: to leave Tod in the woods for his own safety. Tod is happy. He doesn�t know where theygo, but he loves to stay with her and so, he doesn�t understands why she�s so blue
Widow Tweed	thinking We met it seems
Such a short time ago
You looked at me
Needing me so
Yet from your sadness
Our happiness grew
And I found out
I need you too
I remember how we used to play
I recall those rainy days
The fire�s glow
That kept us warm
And now I find
We�re both alone
Goodbye may seem forever
farewell is like the end
but in my heart's
the memory
and there you'll always be.
Now Tod is alone in the forest and he has to learn to do things by himself. Starts raining and he must find a place where to spend the night. The problem is� how to find that place if he doesn�t know how to search. He feels himself sad and lonely. A porcupine watches him from his house at the tree: he is going to enter in a hole but the holes has a proprietor�.
Badger	Hold it, sonny. Back off! Consarn it! Where, where, where do you think you�re goin�?
Tod	Oh! Oh, excuse me. I-I-I-I was just trying to---
Badger	You barge in on somebody�s house like you own it. Tarryhootin� around them woods. Wakin� up folks in the middle of the night.
Tod	Hey, I honestly didn�t know anybody lived here and I---
Badger	Well you know it, now. Now get off my property! Go on, beat it!
Porcupine	I�ve been watching you, sir. You can stay with me if you want to.
Tod	That�s very nice of you.
Porcupine	Come with me.

Meanwhile, Widow Tweed arrives at home. Amos notices Tod�s not with her anymore.
Amos Slade	She dropped that fox off at the game preserve. We�ll get him. We�ll get him.
Chief	Ooh! Well, now if you gotta have a busted leg, ahh, this is the way to do it. Good, good, soft pillow, ha, warm stove, ha, ha. Sure beats sleepin� in that barrel Door creacking open Well now, here comes visitors to see the invalid. Ooh! Ooh! Oooh! Ooooh! but there�s nobody to �help� him How do you like that? They didn�t even ask how I�m feelin�. Hmmm. He enters in the other room whimpering
Amos Slade	Chief, get back in there before I break your other leg. Copper, Copper. Look it here. Now when that fox comes traipsin� along suspectin� nothin��. he shows Copper what will happen with Tod using a log

Next Day Big Mama has gone to the woods searching Tod.
Big Mama	Tod. Tod? Whew! Ooh boy, These old wings ain�t what they used to be sighs Big Mama, you better lose a few pounds. Uh-oh, uh-oh, there he is, there he is. Tod! Tod! Tod!
Vixey	Oh hi, Big Mama!
Big Mama	Oh it�s you, Vixey.
Vixey	Hey, what brings you way out here?
Big Mama	I�m looking for a fox named Tod. He�s new here in the forest.
Vixey	Oh, new? Um, well, what does he look like?
Big Mama	Oh, he�s young; about your age. And handsome.
Vixey	Handsome? Oh say. Gee, uh, he sure sounds nice. Uh, um, I�m not doing anything. I-I�ll help you find him.
Big Mama	laughing Come on, honey. He�s gotta be around here somewhere.
In another part of the forest Tod�s still sleeping with his new fried, the porcupine. This one huts Tod by mistake awaking him.
Tod	Wha-what happened? Where am I? he falls down the tree to the badger�s hole
Badger	So it�s you again, hm? You barged in on me last night, and now you---
Tod	I didn�t mean to.
Badger	Just look at the--- mumbling mess you made. Dognabit , you clumsy bonehead.
Tod	I�m sorry, It was an accident.
Badger	Excuses, excuses.
Porcupine	Mr. Digger, sir? It was so too an accident.
Badger	You keep outta this, you walkin� pincushion.
Porcupine	Why, you-you shouldn�t be so grumpy to someone who�s new un the neighborhood.
Badger	A stranger, eh? Why don�t you go back where you came from?
Tod	Wha--- sighs
Badger	Well, go on. Git goin�. Git!
Tod leaves the place sadly and then Big Mama and Vixey see him.
Vixey	Aw, gosh, he seems so. I don�t know, so down hearted, Big Mama.
Big Mama	Well, you can�t blame him, honey. He was dropped out here and left all alone without a friend in the world.
Vixey	Well, maybe there�s something I could do. You know, cheer him up.
Big Mama	Honey, you just said the magic words! Now, whispering to her
Vixey	What? Oh! But, Big Mama, I don�t---
Big Mama	Darling, don�t move. You look beautiful.
Vixey	Thank you.
Big Mama	Mornin� Tod.
Tod	Oh, hello, Big Mama.
Big Mama	Last night was pretty miserable for you, wasn�t it, honey?
Tod	Just terrible!
Big Mama	Cheer up and look around. The forest is beautiful this morning.
Tod	After last night nothin� looks beautiful then he sees Vixey Wow! Who� who is� is that?
Big Mama	Oh, just another fox. A lady fox.
Tod	Golly! Is she beautiful! I wonder what her name is.
Big Mama	Well, why don�t you go ask her?
Tod	Yeah, yeah. Guess�. Guess I will. I�ll� I�ll go up to her and I�ll say, �you�re the most gorgeous, uh, the most beautiful, uh, f-f�� I�ve never seen anyone anywhere. I�ll say�. Hi.
Vixey	Hello.
Tod & Vixey	Big Mama told me, uh. I just happened to be�.

Vixey	laughing Um, tsk.

Vixey	Oh, oh sure. Why not?
Tod	chuckles Th-thanks, but wha-what is your first name?
Vixey	Vixey.

Vixey	Tod? Thata�s a�. that�s a nice name�. Tod.
Boomer	It looks like the farm boy is makin� it b-b-b-big with her laughs.
Big Mama	Shhh! Now just keep it down.

Tod	Six? Six what? Now Tod is not alone anymore
Amos Slade	reading an advertisment �No hunting�, well now. We ain�t gonna do none of that, are we Copper? We�re just gonna get us a no-good fox. All right boy, get trackin�. Smell him out. Copper finds finally the track Watch got there, Copper? Good work, boy. He�ll be comin� right through here headin� for water. But he won�t be drinkin� any.
Tod	What a beautiful morning, Vixey. You know, I�ve never been happy.
Vixey	Oh, Tod, me too squeaks
Amos Slade	That does it He has put some traps for Tod Amos you crafty old coot. Ha ha! The devil himself couldn�t have done no better!
Meanwhile, Tod and Vixey walk to drink, but suddenly she stops. Something is wrong.
Vixey	Tod? Tod, wait a minute.
Tod	What is it, Vixey?
Vixey	I don�t wanna go in there. It�s too quiet.
Tod	Aw, Vixey.
Amos Slade	Copper has smelt Tod�s presence and growls What?
Vixey	Tod, be careful.
Suddenly Tod hears Amos and when he tries to run some of the traps close behind him. Amos fires but Tod can escape.
Amos Slade	Dad blast it, he�s getting away!
Tod	Quick Vixey! Go on. Head for the burrow he waits for Copper giving time to Vixey
Copper and Tod are now face to face. They are not friends anymore, so they have to fight to save their own life.
Tod	Quick Vixey! Out the back!
Vixey	Tod! There Amos is waiting for them. They are trapped Oh! Oh, no Tod. Amos is making fire in the back, so they�ll have to go out by the other side in which will be Copper waiting for them
Amos Slade	laughing Copper, Copper! We got �em now for sure. This is their only way out. Steady boy, steady. Be ready.
Vixey	Tod! coughing We�re trapped! Tod, I�m scared.
Tod	Quick Vixey! This is our only chance.
Amos Slade	Whoa! Oh I don�t believe it! the foxes escape by the back way out
The pair arrive near the waterfall. There they have only a way to cross by an old big log to the other slope.
Amos Slade	Copper, we�ve trapped him now then a big shadow appears in front of Amos: it�s a grizzly. Amos fires but only hurts him, and then, the bear is really furious. Copper tries to protect his master who�s walking back being trapped by one of his own traps Ah! Ow! Copper!
Tod listens his old friend�s lament and after all, he decides to help him, if he can.
Vixey	Tod!
In the moment in which the bear is going to kill Copper, Tod appears and fights with the giant leading him to the old log. The weight breaks the log and Tod and the bear fall in the water. Only Tod reappears. He�s bad hurt and Amos sees that it is his chance to kill him. But, now is Copper who protect his old friend.
Copper	Tod?
Amos Slade	Come on, Copper. Get outta the way the dog doesn�t obey and the hunter understands he�s doing wrog and leaves Tod Well� come on, boy. Let�s go home.
Both friends smile each other. They�re still the best of friends.
Boomer and Dinky continue their hunting of the caterpillar.
Dinky	Shh, shh, This is it. We got him for sure now.
Boomer	Oh my g-g-gosh! Whoa!
Dinky	Yow! Wha-what happened?
Boomer	Hey, there�s something very familiar about those eyes, Dinky.
Dinky	Nah, it couldn�t be. Could it? the caterpillar is now a beautiful butterfly
Big Mama	laughing Bye Squeeks, bye. Good luck, honey.
Amos Slade	Ouch! You--- you�re killing me! Ouch! grunting and groaning
Widow Tweed	Amos Slade, will you hold still?
Amos Slade	Ouch!
Widow Tweed	You�re behaving like a child.
Amos Slade	Well, for gosh sakes, you�re hurtin� my foot, woman!
Widow Tweed	Nonsense! Your foot is mendin� fine. You�ll soon be yourself. Oh land sakes, I don�t know if I like that laughing
Amos Slade	Ow! Be careful! Ouch! Oh! Ah!
Chief	Huh! He�s sure makin� a big fuss over a little ol� hurt leg.
Copper	he recalls his time as puppy with Tod. Copper? You�re my best friend. And you�re mine too, Tod. And we�ll be friends forever, won�t we? Yeah, forever.
