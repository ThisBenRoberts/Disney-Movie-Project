	My story begins in London, not so very long ago. Yet so much has happened since then, that it seems like an eternity. At that time I lived with my pet in a bachelor flat just off Regents Park. It was a beautiful spring day, a tedious time of the year for bachelors. Oh� that�s my pet, Roger. Roger Radcliff, a musician of sorts. Ha-ha. No, no, I�m the one with spots. My name�s Pongo. As far as I could see the old notion that �a bachelor�s life was so glamorous and carefree� was all nonsense. It was downright dull sighs It was plain to see that my old pet needed someone. If it were left up to Roger, we�d be bachelors forever. He was married to his work, writing songs. Songs about romance� of all things, something he knew absolutely nothing about Roger�s playing piano Oh, he�s intelligent enough as humans so. And I think you could say, Roger is a rather handsome animal in his way. I could see no reason why my pet didn�t deserve an attractive mate, but al least I was determinated to do my best. Of course, dogs are a pretty poor judge of human beauty, but I had a rough idea of what to look for He�s looking out from the window spotting the candidates We see an Afghan Hmm! Unusual breed chuckles Very unusual. Hmm! Oh, surely not. Well now, what have we here? Hmm. Well, a little� too short coupled. Nope! I say! Well, I do say! Now there�s a fancy breed. Hmm. Perhaps a little too fancy. Yes, much too fancy. Oh! Too old. Too young. It was a problem, a real problem. Well, now that�s a bit more like it! It�s a Dalmatian The most beautiful creature on four legs! Now if only the girl� Well! She�s very lovely too! It was almost too good to be true. I�d never find another pair like that, not if I looked for a hundred years. Ah, they�re heading for the park. A perfect meeting place� if I can only arrange it. Uh-oh, but Roger never stopped work �til after 5:00. That could be too late He changes the time and barks attracting Roger�s attention .
Roger	Looking the clock After 5:00 already. Fancy that. All right Pongo, all right boy. Pongo�s barking and yipping Pongo boy! Take it easy! What�s all the hurry? Pongo boy, slow down.
Pongo	I was afraid we�d missed them. Perhaps they passed on by the park. Then suddenly� I spotted them. It was a perfect situation if I planned it right. I couldn�t depend on Roger. I knew what he�d do. He�d settle on the grass, puff his pipe and that would be it. No, it was all up to me. Well as they pass, Anita and Perdita take notice of them At first I had no particular plan just anything to attract attention. You know stir things up a bit He takes off Roger�s hat .
Roger	Pongo, you silly old thing! C�mon! Let�s have it, boy. Pongo! yipping Pongo! He leaves the hat on the bench where Anita�s seated .
Pongo	For a while it seemed to work. At least they had seen one another. Things were going along first-rate. But for some strange reason they left!
Roger	C�mon, you old renegade. We�re going home.
Pongo	But I wasn�t giving up. I was determinated that somehow they just had to meet.
Roger	Oh!
Anita	Ohhh!
Roger	I beg your pardon. Please, excuse me.
Anita	I must say, what on earth!
Roger	Oh dear!
Anita	Oh really! Good heavens!
Roger	Oooh!
Anita	Ahh! Ahh! Perdita tries to stop them and she breaks Anita�s dress. The pair end up toppling into a pond Oh, oh. Oh my new spring suit and my new hat!
Roger	Ah, ah� I�m terribly sorry. Please, let me help you I�m so sorry. I don�t know what�s come over him. I�m so sorry. He�s never acted this way before.
Anita	Oh, never mind! Never mind! Please, just go away. You�ve done enough. Please? Oh! she takes her handkerchief that is wet .
Roger	Oh, I say. Here, take mine it�s wet too
Anita	Oh! they laugh. For the very first time Perdita looks to Pongo
In a few weeks there was a double wedding for Pongo and Perdita, Roger and Anita, and the dogs settled down to a life of pleasant domesticity with their happy pets.
Priest	Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her in sickness and in health; and forsaking all others keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall live?
Roger	I will.
Pongo	For the first six months or so we lived in a small house near the park, a modest little place but just right for two couples who were just starting out. In the window we see Perdita and Pongo resting. She sighs happily Perdita, darling, are you all right?
Perdita	chuckles Oh, of course, dear. After all, dogs were having puppies long before our time.
Pongo	He chuckles happily Oh, that�s Nanny, a wonderful cook and housekeeper. She�s such a kind understanding soul. You know, at times she seems almost canine.
Anita	Roger, dear, tea time! Tea time!
Roger	Still playing piano Be down in a minute. Ta-tum-ti-ta-tum whistling Do you like my new song.
Anita	Ta-tum-ti-ta-tum. Such clever lyrics.
Roger	Ho ho! Chuckles Melody first, my dear. And then the lyrics, hm? car horn
Perdita	Oh, Pongo� it�s her. It�s that devil woman A car stops in front of the house
Roger	Oh, must be Cruella, your dearly devoted old schoolmate, Cruella de Vil. That�s it! Cruella de Vil Cruella de Vil if she doesn't scare you no evil thing will
Anita	Oh Roger To see her is to take a sudden chill
Anita	Oh
Cruella
Cruella she's like a spider waiting for the... kill
Anita	Roger, she'll hear you Look out for Cruella de Vil
Anita	Let her in, Nanny.
Cruella	Anita, darling!
Anita	How are you?
Cruella	Miserable as usual. Perfectly wretched! Where are they? Where are they? For heaven sakes, where are they?
Anita	Who, Cruella?
Cruella	The puppies! in loud rude voice The puppies! Not time for games. Where are the little brutes?
Anita	Oh, it�ll be al least three weeks. No rushing these things, you know.
Cruella	chuckles Anita, you�re such a wit. Here, dog, here. Here dog Pongo growls
Anita	Cruella, isn�t that a new fur coat?
Cruella	Oh, my only true love, darling. I live for furs. I worship furs! Aaaah�. After all, is there a woman in all this wretched world who doesn�t?
Anita	Oh, I�d like a nice fur but there are many other things�
Cruella	Sweet, simple Anita chuckles I know, I know! This horrid little house is your dreamed castle. Ha, ha, ha! And poor Roger is your bold and fearless Sir Galahad! Ha ha ha!
Anita	Oh Cruella!
Cruella	Then of course you have your little spotted friends. Oh yes, I must say� such a perfectly beautiful coats.
Anita	Won�t you have some tea?
Cruella	I�ve got to run. Let me know when the puppies arrive. You will, won�t you dear?
Anita	Yes Cruella.
Cruella	Don�t forget, it�s a promise. See you in three weeks. Cheerio, cheerio darling she slams the door
Anita	Oooh!
Roger	At first you think
Cruella is a devil
but after time
has worn away the shock
you come to realize
you've seen
her kind of eyes
watching you
from underneath a rock
Anita	You're no help

this vampire bat
this inhuman beast
she ought to be locked up
and never released
the world was such
a wholesome place until
Cruella
Cruella de Vil
Anita	They kiss Oh Roger, you are an idiot! They laugh
In the kitchen.
Pongo	Perdy?
Perdita	That�s witch! That devil woman. She wants our puppies. That�s all she�s after.
Pongo	Oh, don�t worry, Perdy. They�re on to her. Nothing�s going to happen to our puppies.
Perdita	What does she want with them? She can�t possibly love them. Oh Pongo crying I was so happy at first, but now I--- Oh, I--- I wish we weren�t having any.
A raining night. Perdita�s going to have her puppies. She�s been helped by Anita and Nanny while Pongo and his pet waits patiently in the next room.
Pongo	Poor Perdita. Of course she had no choice. The puppies arrived right on schedule one wild and stormy night in October.
Roger	Ooh! Steady, boy. He�s puffing his pipe and Pongo licks his hand
Nanny	The puppies are here! shouting Oh--- the puppies are here!
Roger	H-H-How many?
Nanny	Eight.
Roger	Eight? By George, Pongo! Eight puppies!
Nanny	Ten!
Anita	Eleven!
Nanny	Eleven.
Roger	Eleven? Eleven puppies, Pongo boy!
Nanny	Wait a minute now, wait a minute� thirteen!. No, no, no fourteen, ohhh, fifteen!
Roger	Fifteen?
Nanny	And the mother�s doing fine, love. Oh, you lucky thing, you.
Roger	Fifteen puppies? Why, Pongo boy, That�s marvellous! It�s fabulous! Why, you old rascal!
Nanny	She enters sobbing with something in her hands Fourteen. Just fourteen. We lost one. Oh, poor little thing.
Roger	Oh, pongo. It�s just one of those things. And yet? And yet I wonder� he tries to resuscitate him and he does! Look Pongo! Anita! Nanny! Fifteen! We still have fifteen!
Anita	Oh Roger, he�s all right! Thank heaven!
Roger	See? He�s just as good as new.
Anita	Can you imagine, Roger, fifteen puppies! Suddenly a sinister shadow appears in the door and a wellknown voice ask
Cruella	Fifteen! Fifteen puppies! How marvellous! How marvellous, how perfectly� she sees the puppy Ugh! The devil take it! They�re mongrels� no spots! No spots at all! What a horrid little white rat! Ugh!
Nanny	They�re not mongrels! They�ll get their spots. Just wait and see.
Anita	That�s right. They�ll have their spots in a few weeks.
Cruella	Oh, well, in that case I�ll take them all. The whole litter. Just name your price, dear
Anita	I�m afraid we can�t give them up. Poor Perdita. She�d be heartbroken.
Cruella	Anita, don�t be ridiculous. You can�t afford to keep them. You can scarcely feed yourselves.
Anita	I�m sure we�ll get along.
Cruella	Chuckling Yes, I know! I know! Roger�s� Roger�s songs! laughing Enough of this nonsense I�ll pay you twice what they�re worth. I�m being more than generous. Blast this pen. Blast this wretched, wretched pen! she puts ink spots in Roger and Pongo who are so furious When can the puppies leave their mother? Two weeks? Three weeks?
Roger	Never.
Cruella	What?
Roger	We�re n-n-not selling the puppies. Not a single one. D-do you understand?
Cruella	chuckling Anita, is he serious? I really don�t know Roger.
Anita	Well, Cruella, he---
Cruella	Surely he must be joking!
Roger	No, no, no. I-I-I-I mean it. You�re not getting one. N-n-not one. And that�s--- final! Pongo nods his head
Cruella	Shouts Why, you horrid man! You� you� Al right, keep the little beasts for all I care. Do as you like with them. Dorwn them! But I warn you, Anita. I�m through with all of you! I�ll get even. Just wait. You�ll be sorry, you fools! You, you idiots! she slams the door
Anita	embracing Roger Oh Roger! You were magnificent, darling!
Nanny	Oh he was a bloomin� hero, ma�am. Indeed he was. A bloomin� hero!
Pongo	he runs to tell Perdita the good news Perdy? Perdy darling? Perdy, we�re keeping the puppies every single one of them. My ol� pet Roger, he told that devil woman off. He told her off, Perdy. She�s gone darling, she�s gone for good.
Perdita	Oh Pongo Now she�s happy sights Some weeks later our dogs are watching their favourite TV programm.

Puppy	Look at him run, the old coward.
Patch	That old Dirty Dawson! The yellow-livered old skunk! I�d like to tear his gizzard out.

Jasper	There they go, Horace, me lad, out for their evening constitutional. A lovely pair of turtledoves. Around the corner and off to the park.
Horace	Yeah, I don�t like it, Jasper. One more pinch and they�ll throw the keys away.
Jasper	Oh, come off it, Horace. We�re getting plenty of boodle.

In the park, Pongo barks as loud as he can. He does to north, south, east and west.
