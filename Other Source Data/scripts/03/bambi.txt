Life may be swift and fleeting
Hope may die
Yet love's beautiful music
Comes each day
Like the dawn

Love is a song that never ends
One simple theme repeating
Like the voice of a heavenly choir
Love's sweet music flows on

The music introduces us in the depth of the forest, where the animals of this story live. The chirping of the birds lead us to the place where our friends are going to appear.
An old owl arrives to his tree to rest during the day. In the same tree live some squirrels, sleeping at that hour of the day; we can see a nest where three chicks are waiting for their mother who is bringing them some food. The day breaks and all the animals must to awake: a small mouse washes his face with a dewdrop. Everything seems to be calm, in peace, but suddenly the birds spread the new: the little prince is born.
Owl	Who-o, who-o snoring Who-o, who-o, who-o
Birds	Tweet-tweet-tweet Tweet-tweet-tweet
All the animals stop their doings; they listen the news so exciting. In that moment a little rabbit appears near the tree where the Old owl is sleeping. This rabbit is our friend Thumper who thumps to the owl wakes up.
Thumper	Wake up, wake up!
Owl	Oh, what now?
Thumper	Wake up, friend Owl!
Owl	What�s going around on here?
Thumper	It�s happened! It�s happened! All his brothers and sisters are jumping all around full in excitement The new prince is born! We�re going to see him! Come on! You�d better hurry up!
The animals run into the depth of the forest, and in a clearing the camera shows a deer with her newborn fawn, the new Prince who is sleeping.
Animal 1	Oh my!
Animal 2	Well look!
Animal 3	Well, isn�t he cute?
Everybody admires the newborn. The owl, Thumper and his family arrive.
Owl	Well, this is quite an occasion, yes sir. Isn't every day a prince is born to Bambi�s mother You�re to be congratulated.
Animals	Congratulations! Congratulations!
Bambi's Mother	to the animals Thank you very much. Licking Bambi Come on, wake up. We have company.
Bambi opens his eyes and looks a bit surprised because of all the animals
Animals	Hello, hello! Hello little Prince! Hello little Prince!
Owl	Who-o who-o, heh, heh, heh, who-o who-o laughs. Bambi seems to be afraid of him, but sooner he laughs him back softly
Thumper	Look, he�s trying to get up! Thumper takes advantage of this situation and stays closer watching and smelling the newborn; but the fact is that Bambi is not sure yet on his legs and falls Kind of wobbly, isn�t he?
Thumper's Mother	angrily Thumper!
Thumper	Well, he is. to Bambi aren�t ya?
Bambi	sneezing At-twat! Everybody laughs
Owl	Bambi is so tired, and yawns Looks to me like he�s getting kind of sleepy. to the animals I think it�s time we all left. Come on, shoo-o, shoo-o. to a little squirrel who is absorbed looking Bambi Come on, shoo-o, shoo-o! Psst. to the birds Psst.
All the animals leave except Thumper who wants to see into the Bambi�s mouth because he is still yawning
Thumper's Mother	Thumper! Come on.
Thumper	to Bambi�s Mother What-cha gonna call him?
Bambi's Mother	Well, I think I�ll call him Bambi.
Thumper	thinking Bambi. Yep, I guess that�ll do all right he leaves
Bambi's Mother	to herself and Bambi Bambi, my little Bambi.
The camera moves away leading us to the top of a crag where the entire scene has been watching by a majestic stag. The image turns to black.
Scene changes. Bambi and his mother are walking by the forest. The little deer is discovering lot of things and animals. From a tree a squirrel watches them in their walk
Squirrel	Walking already. Well, what do you know!
Mrs. Quail	to Bambi�s Mother Good morning!
Bambi's Mother	Good morning Mrs. Quail.
Mrs. Quail	And where�s the young prince this--- in that moment Bambi appears to Bambi Oh, good morning Bambi!
Mrs. Quail's chicks	to Bambi Good morning young Prince! They continue after their mother, but one of them returns
Chick	Goodbye!
Opossums' Mother	Good morning young Prince!
Opossums	Good morning young Prince!
Bambi is a bit surprised because this family has their heads down. He continues his walk but something strange appears in front of him. From the underground a mole appears.
Mole	Good morning. Nice sunny day! He disappears again
Bambi continues his walk jumping but he looses the balance and falls down.
Thumper's family	What�s the matter? What happened?
Thumper	Did the young Prince falls down?
Rabbit	Is he hurt?
Bambi's Mother	No, he�s all right.
Thumper	to Bambi�s Mother He doesn�t walk very good, does he?
Thumper's Mother	Thumper!
Thumper	Yes mama?
Thumper's Mother	What did your father tell you this morning?
Thumper	reciting If you can�t say something nice don�t say nothing at all
Bambi's Mother	Come on, Bambi. Get up. Try again.
Rabbits	Come on! Get up! Get up! Try again!
Bambi gets up and walks with his new friends. All of them laugh, jump and run. Thumper runs to an old trunk and there, using his foot, thumps.
Thumper	I�m thumping. That�s why they all me Thumper.
Echo	...call me Thumper...
Thumper	Thumper!
Echo	...Thumper!...
They continue jumping and playing. The bunnies jump over a trunk but Bambi stop in front of it. His friends cheer him up to jump like them.
Thumper	Come on! You can do it! Hop over it, like this.
Rabbits	Hop over it, hop over it, hip over it, hope over it. Like this.
Bambi smiles and tries, but he fails. He is trapped over the trunk.
Thumper	You didn�t hop far enough.
Bambi pass one of his legs over the trunk but when he is going to pass the other the legs are tangled up and he falls down again. Thumper helps him.
Thumper	That�s it! Now the other one. Gee whiz, what happened that time?
They all continue their walk. The birds are chirping happily and Bambi and friends go to see them closer. Bambi ask with his eyes who are they.
Thumper	Those are birds.
Bambi	trying to talk Burrr! Burrr!
Thumper	Look, he�s trying to talk.
Bambi	Burr-r-r!
Rabbit	He�s trying to say bird.
Thumper	Say bird!

Bambi	happy and proud Bird, bird, bird, bird. He sees a butterfly and follows her calling her bird too Bird!
Thumper	No that's not a bird. That�s a butterfly.
Bambi	Butterfly! Thumper nods Butter--- but the butterfly has flown away. Then Bambi sees some flowers and he thinks they are butterflies too Butterfly!
Thumper	No that's a flower.
Bambi	surprised Flower?
Thumper	Uh-uh. It�s pretty he smells them and Bambi imitates him

Flower	Oh that's all right. He can call me a flower, if he wants to giggles I don'� mind.
Bambi	looking both Thumper and Flower Pretty, pretty Flower!
Flower	Ohh giggles Gosh!
Bambi and Thumper continue their walk for the forest but suddenly a storm starts with lightings and thunders.
Thumper	I think I�d better go home how he leaves Bambi alone
Bambi runs with his mother and they arrive to the little cave where they live. It�s raining

Bambi	Mother, what we gonna do today?
Bambi's Mother	I�m going to take you to the meadow.
Bambi	Meadow? What�s the meadow?
Bambi's Mother	It�s a very wonderful place.
Bambi	Then, why haven�t we been there before?
Bambi's Mother	You weren�t big enough.
Bambi	Mother, you know what?
Bambi's Mother	What?
Bambi	We�re not the only deer in the forest.
Bambi's Mother	Where did you hear that?
Bambi	Thumper told me.
Bambi's Mother	Well, he�s right. There are many deer in the forest, beside us.
Bambi	Then, why don�t I ever see them?
Bambi's Mother	You will sometime.
Bambi	On the meadow
Bambi's Mother	perhaps. Hush now. We�re almost there. She stops and watches everything carefully
Bambi	The meadow! He runs without doubt
Bambi's Mother	Wait! Bambi wait! You must never rush out on the meadow. There might be danger. Out there we are unprotected. The meadow is wide and open; there are no trees or bushes to hide us, so we have to be very careful. Wait here. I�ll go out first. If the meadow is safe I�ll call you. Bambi�s so afraid. His mother goes out to the meadow, carefully, watching and listening everything Come on, Bambi. It�s all right. Come on.
At first, Bambi is not sure, but after a while he goes out with her and soon both are jumping and playing in the meadow.
Rabbits	Good morning Prince Bambi!
Thumper's Mother	Good morning young Prince.
Bambi	Hello. Wat-cha eating?
Rabbits	Clover
Thumper	It�s awfully good. It�s delicious! Why don�t you try some? Bambi starts eating some of green but... No, no not that green stuff, just eat the blossoms, that�s the good stuff.
Thumper's Mother	Thumper! he is going to eat a blossom
Thumper	Yes mama?
Thumper's Mother	What did your father tell you?
Thumper	About what?
Thumper's Mother	About eating the blossoms and leaving the greens.
Thumper	Oh, that one. Clearing the throat and reciting Eating green is a special treat. It makes long ears and great big feet in low voice But it sure is awful stuff to eat secretly to Bambi I made that last part up myself.
Bambi starts to eat again but from the same place where he is eating a frog appears
Frog	Watch out!
Bambi decides to follow her, but the frog disappears in the river. Bambi jumps in it until he finally stops and sees his image reflected in the river. But something strange has happened in it because now there are two reflected faces. Bambi is surprised when one of the faces giggles. He meets another deer and tries to run away but the deer follows him everywhere. Finally he takes refuge with his mother.
Bambi's Mother	to Bambi That�s little Faline
Faline	to her mother He�s kind of bashful, isn�t he Mamma?
Faline's Mother	Well, maybe he wouldn�t be if you�d say hello.
Faline	Hello Bambi he doesn�t answer I said hello
Bambi's Mother	Well, aren�t you going to answer her? he denies You�re not afraid, are you? he denies again Well, then go ahead, go on! Say hello.
Bambi	bashfully Hello.
Faline	giggles Bambi looks at her so angry
Bambi	Yeeoow!
Both finally play together. In that moment all the young male deer appear in the meadow. Bambi watches them impressed and follows them. Suddenly everyone in the meadow stops and look to the majestic old stag who is approaching. He stops in front of Bambi and look at him right into his eyes, saying nothing. Bambi gives back a smile but the old deer seems to ignore him. Bambi is now afraid. Then his mother arrives next to him
Bambi	He stopped and looked at me
Bambi's Mother	Yes I know.
Bambi	Why was everyone still when he came on the meadow?
Bambi's Mother	Everyone respects him. For of all the deer in the forest not one has lived half so long. He�s very brave, and very wise. That�s why he�s known as the Great Prince of the forest. The camera shows us how the old deer moves away to the depth of the forest, but suddenly he stops and watches how screech the birds. The message is clear: the deer are in danger. He comes back to the meadow and gives the advice. All the deer runs for their lives
Faline's Mother	Faline!
Bambi's Mother	Bambi! Bambi is confused and he can�t find his mother
Bambi	Mother!
Bambi's Mother	Bambi! Bambi!
Bambi	Mother! Mother! Mother! The Great prince appears in front of him and led him out the meadow with his mother. Gunshots can be heard. After a while, Bambi�s mother watches the place. The danger is over
Bambi's Mother	Come on out Bambi, come on. It�s safe now. We don�t have to hide any longer.
Bambi	What happened mother? Why did we all run?
Bambi's Mother	Man was in the forest.
The seasons pass, spring, autumn, winter... Bambi is going to discover the snow.
Bambi	Mother, look! What�s all that white stuff?
Bambi's Mother	Why it�s snow.
Bambi	Snow?
Bambi's Mother	Winter has came
Bambi goes out the cave and plays with the now, surprised by the footsteps he is doing in it. Walking he arrives to the lake where is Thumper playing.
Thumper	Hiya Bambi! Watch what can I do! Whee! he�s skating using his feet Come on! It�s all right, look he thumps in the iced water The water is stiff.
Bambi	Yipee! Bambi tries to emulate him but his legs are of no use in it, so he falls down
Thumper	Some fun, huh, Bambi? Come on, get up. Like this. Bambi tries again but slips laughing No, no, no Thumper helps Bambi to get up his legs. It�s a difficult matter Kind of wobbly, aren�t ya? You gotta watch both ends at the same time. I guess you�d better unwind it they splash in the snow Wow!
Someone is snoring near and Thumper decides to investigate. It�s his friend flower.
Thumper	Wake up! Wake up!
Bambi	Wake up Flower
Flower	Is it spring yet?
Bambi	Nope. Winter �s just started.
Thumper	What-cha doing? Hibernating?
Flower	Uh-huh
Bambi	What-cha want to do that for?
Flower	laughs All us flowers sleep in winter. Well, good night. Ah-h-h he continues sleeping
Storm of snow. The deer walk trying to find some food. Each day is more difficult to find it.
In the cave
Bambi	sighs Winter sure is long, isn�t it?
Bambi's Mother	it seems long but it won�t last forever.
Bambi	I�m awful hungry mother.
Bambi's Mother	yes I know.
The storm has ceased and Bambi�s Mother has a surprise for her son.
Bambi's Mother	Bambi? Bambi, come here. Look. New spring grass Both start eating but suddenly Bambi�s Mother feels something in the air. Danger Bambi, quick, the thicket! Gunshots Faster, Bambi! Don�t look back! Keep running! ! Gunshots. Bambi keeps running but after a while, in the cave, he notices he�s alone. His mother hasn�t arrived yet
Bambi	We made it. We made it, Mother. We--- Mother? There's no answer Mother! Now it�s snowing Mother, where are you? he goes out looking for her Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Crying Mother? Gasps. Suddenly the old deer appears through the snowstorm
Great Prince	Your mother can�t be with you any more Bambi look at him sadly and understands the fact that his mother is dead Come, my son they both go away together

Owl	Same thing every spring. Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, love sweet song. Humph. Pain in the pinfeathers, I call it.
The tree in which is the old owl trying to sleep is now trembling because a young deer is edging his antlers.
Owl	Stop it! Get out of here all of you he can�t fix his sight and think there�re many deer and you too.
Bambi	Hello friend owl. Don�t you remember me?
Owl	Why, it�s the young Prince, Bambi! My, my how you�ve changed. Turn around there. Let me look at you. I see you�ve traded in your spots for a pair of antlers. Hee, hee, hee. You know just the other day I was talking to myself about you, and we were wondering what had become of you.
Thumper	Hello Bambi! Remember me? thumping
Bambi	Thumper!
Thumper	Right-o! ha, ha, ha
Flower	Hi fellas!
Bambi	Flower!
Flower	bashfully Yeah!
A pair of birds are flying and playing around as a fools
Flower	Well, what�s the matter with them?
Thumper	Why are they acting that way?
Owl	Hee-hee! Why, don�t you know? They�re twitter-patted.
Bambi, Thumper and Flower	Twitter-patted?
Owl	yes. Nearly everybody gets twitter-patted in the springtime. For example, you�re walking along minding your own business; you�re looking neither to the left, nor to the right when all of a sudden you run smack into a pretty face Who-o! Who-o! You begin to get weak in the knees, your head�s in a whirl! And then you feel light as feather, and before you know it you�re walking on air, and then, you know what? You're knocked for a loop! And you completely lose your head!
Thumper	horrified Gosh that's awful.
Flower	Gee-whiz
Bambi	terrible
Owl	And that ain�t all. It can happen to anybody, so you�d better be careful. It could happen to you! to Bambi and you to Thumper and... looking to Flower who�s smiling, yes it could even happen to you.
Thumper	Well it�s not going to happen to me.
Bambi	Me neither
Flower	Me neither
They leave so sure of themselves. In their walking a female skunk sees Flower and she runs to hide herself in a bunch of flowers. When our friend Flower pass near he listens someone giggling, so he stops and looks around. From the bunch of flower two big blue beautiful eyes are looking right to him. At first he thinks he�s dreaming and decides to continue with his friends, but that pair of big blue eyes are saying hello. They kiss by accident but Flower is now... twitter-patted. Bambi looks back and sees how Flower is now following the female skunk. Flower looks at them and lifts his shoulders: he can�t help it.
Flower	Hee, hee, hee
Thumper	Huh! Twitter-patted!
Bambi and Thumper continue their walk. From the distance a beautiful female rabbit sees Thumper and she�s so impress by his sight. She starts flirting
Rabbit	Ah-h-h! Oh! A-hem
Thumper stops immediately and sees the rabbit flirting.
Rabbit	humming La, la, la, la, la Oh she says hello with her ear and Thumper answer back. She continues humming la, la, la, la. Hello she kisses him and Thumper starts thumping without control. He�s twitter-patted also. Bambi sees the couple and continues alone la, la, la.
Bambi goes to the river and there he sees a familiar face reflected: it�s Faline
Faline	Hello Bambi. Don�t you remember me? I�m Faline He�s afraid of her and tries to escape but he falls down into the river; he gets up but then his antlers are winded in a tree. Then Faline approaches and leaks him. In that moment Bambi�s face changed: he�s twitter-patted too.
Bambi	ah-h-h-h- he feels himself on air, but the dream is broken by the presence of another young deer, Ronno, who tries to obtain Faline�s love
Faline	Bambi! Bambi! Bambi! Bambi has to fight against Ronno; he must save Faline. The fight is hard but Bambi wins
Off singing voice	I bring you a song
And I sing as I go
For I want you to know
That I'm looking for romance

I bring you a song
In the hope that you'll see
When you're looking at me
That I'm looking for love

I'm seeking that glow
Only found when
Only found on that wonderful day
When all longing is through
I'm seeking that glow
Only found when
The thrill is complete
Only found when
Two hearts chance to beat
To the strain of a waltz
That's both tender and new

I bring you a song
For I'm seeking romance
You're by my side
There's a moon up above
It shines with a light
That's so mellow and bright
It's easy to see that tonight
We shall fall in love

I bring you a song
For I'm seeking romance
Something wakes up Bambi who leaves Faline to see what's happening. Far away there's smoke.
Great Prince	It is man. He is here again. There are many this time. We must go deep into the forest. Hurry, follow me!
Bambi is going to follow him but he remembers Faline's alone
Bambi	Faline! He returns to the place where he had been sleeping with Faline but bow she's gone
Meanwhile, Faline has just woken up and she doesn't find Bambi. She hear the birds' screeching and tries to find him
Faline	Bambi? Bambi, where are you? Now she's afraid Bambi! Bambi!
Bambi arrives late, Faline's gone.
Bambi	Faline? Faline! Faline!
All the animals know that the danger has just come. Everyone tries to hide.
Pheasant 1	horrified Listen! He's coming!
Pheasant 2	Hush!
Pheasant 3	Be quiet.
Pheasant 1	He's coming closer!
Pheasant 2	Be calm, don't get excited.
Pheasant 1	We'd better fly
Pheasant 2	No. No, don't fly. Whatever you do, don't fly!
Pheasant 1	He's almost here, I can't stand it any longer!
He flies and we can hear a gunshot. His body falls down. The other animals run away
Faline	Bambi! Bambi!
Bambi	Faline!
Suddenly it can be heard dogs barking. They are now after Faline. She runs away but soon she's trapped. Bambi appears in the very last moment to rescue her.
Bambi	Quick Faline! Jump!
Faline does it and runs away. When Bambi is jumping a crag a gunshot is heard. Bambi falls down bounded. Now all the forest is on fire. Bambi can't move but the Great Prince appears and helps him to move. Both escape by the river.
Great Prince	Get up Bambi! Get up. You must get up! Get up! Get up! Now come with me.
They finally arrived to an island in the middle of the river. Most of the animals are they. Among them is Faline who is waiting for Bambi.
Faline	Bambi! They kiss
Time has past and something marvelous has just happened.
Owl	Who-o, who-o
A family of rabbits starts thumping. It's Thumper's family.
Thumper	Wake up! Wake up friend owl!
Bunnies	Wake up, friend owl!
Owl	Oh, what now? Hey, what's going around here?
Flower	It's happened.
Owl	Happened?
Flower	Yes, in the thicket. to his son Hurry up Bambi.
Bambi	Yes Papa, I'm coming.
In the thicket there's a familiar scene: a deer with her fawns. It's Faline.
Animal 1	Oh my.
Animal 2	Well!
Raccoon	Look!
Animal 3	Two of them.
Owl	Hee, hee, hee. I don't believe I've never seen a more likely looking pair of fawns to Faline. Prince Bambi ought to be mighty proud.
The camera shows Bambi and the Great Prince at the top of a crag.
Off singing voice	Love is a song that never ends

Like the voice of a heavenly choir
Love's sweet music flows on.
