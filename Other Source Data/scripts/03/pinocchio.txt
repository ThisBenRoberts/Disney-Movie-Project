
Off singing voice	When you wish upon a star
makes no difference who you are
anything your heart desires
will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
no request is too extreme
when you wish upon a star
as dreamers do

Fate is kind
she brings to those who love
the sweet fulfillment of
their secret longing
Jiminy Cricket	Pretty, huh? I�ll bet a lot of you folks don�t believe that, about a wish coming true, do you? Well, I didn�t. Of course I�m just a cricket singing my way from hearth to hearth but� let me tell you what made me change my mind he opens a book entitled �Pinocchio� One night, a long time� ahem. Pardon me. Wait�ll I fix this thing. There. One night a long time ago� my travels took me to a quaint little village. It was a beautiful night. The stars were shining like diamonds high above the roofs of that sleepy old town. Pretty as a picture. As I wandered along the crooked streets there wasn�t a soul to be seen. The only sign of life was a lighted window in the shop of a wood-carver named� Geppetto. So I hopped over and looked in. It was a shame to see a nice cheerful fire like that going to waste. So what do I do? I go in! I looked around. Of course, being in a strange place like that I didn�t know what to expect. A cricket can�t be too careful, you know. Soon as I saw there was no one about I made myself at home. As I stood there warming my� myself I took a look around. Well sir, you never saw such a place. The most fantastic clocks you ever laid your eyes on and all carved out of wood. And cute little music boxes, each one a work of art. And shelf after shelf of toys and� and then something else caught my eye. A puppet! You know, one of those marionette things, all strings and joints chuckle Cute little fellow. Ding, ding. Going up? Good piece of wood too.
Geppetto	Well now, it won�t take much longer.
Figaro	Meow
Geppetto	Just a little more paint and he�s all finished. I think he�ll be al right, don�t you, Figaro?
Figaro	Purr.
Geppetto	humming Tra, la, la
Jiminy Cricket	Ahh! Beg pardon.
Geppetto	See chuckle That makes a big difference.
Jiminy Cricket	Ver-r-ry good! Very, very good. Well, you can�t please everybody.
Geppetto	Now I have just the name for you: Pinocchio! Do you like it, Figaro? No? You do, don�t you Cleo? Well, we�ll leave it to little woodenhead. You like it? That settles it! Pinocchio it is! Come on, now, we�ll try you out. Music Professor! He works the puppet�s strings so that it nods �yes�. Geppetto pushes the button of a music box. Then, by working his strings Geppetto makes Pinocchio dance
Jiminy Cricket	Hey! Ouch, ouch! Take it easy there! Oh, break it up, will you? Whew! Lotta down beats in there.
Geppetto	humming Little woodenhead
go play your part
bring a little joy
to every heart
little do you know
and yet it's true
that I'm mighty
proud of you
Little wooden feet
and best of all
little wooden seat
in case your fall
Oh no! how graceful!
my little woodenhead
Cleo, meet Pinocchio. Say, "How do you do?". Say hello to Figaro. Oops! oh oh no! up to mischief already. You see what happens? Boo!. Up we go! Ah, you�re a cute little fellow.
Figaro	Meow, purr, purr.
Geppetto	And that smile! You know I---
Figaro	Meow.
Geppetto	You rascal! Jealous, huh? You know Pinocchio I think Figaro is jealous of you. Oh, don�t worry Figaro. I sti--- clocks chiming Uh-oh. I wander what time is it. It�s getting late. Come now. We go to bed. Good night, Pinocchio. Little funny face. Good night, Cleo, my little water baby. Figari? You say good night too. Go on! Now go to sleep, my little mermaid. Good night.
Jiminy Cricket	Oh hum yawning This is my idea of comfort. Solid comfort.
Geppetto	chuckling Look at him, Figaro. He almost looks alive. Wouldn�t it be nice if he was a real boy? Oh, well. Come on. We go to sleep. Ah Figaro, I forgot to open the window. Oh Figaro! Look, look the wishing star! Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight I wish I may. I wish I might, have the wish I make tonight. Figaro, you know what I wished? I wished that my little Pinocchio might be a real boy! Wouldn�t that be nice? Just think, a real boy.
Jiminy Cricket	A very lovely thought, but not at all practical.
Geppetto	� a real� boy snoring
Jiminy Cricket can�t sleep because of the clocks� noise and Geppetto�s roar. That night when everyone was sound sleep the Blue Fairy comes down from her star.
Jiminy Cricket	Quiet! After all, enough�s enough. Now what�s up? he sees a strange light, a brilliant glow which grows more dazzling every minute. It is the Wishing Star Hey, what�s going on here? in the center of the glow appears a very beautiful woman dressed in robes of flowing blue As I live and breathe, a fairy! Mmm-mmm.
Blue Fairy	Good Geppetto, you have given so much happiness to others. You deserve to have your wish come true. Little puppet made of pine wake the wand touches Pinocchio The gift of life is tine Pinocchio comes to life.
Jiminy Cricket	Whew! What they can�t do these days.
Pinocchio	blinking his eyes and raising his wooden arm I can move! I can talk! I can walk!
Blue Fairy	Yes Pinocchio, I�ve given you life.
Pinocchio	Why?
Blue Fairy	Because tonight Geppetto wished for a real boy.
Pinocchio	Am I a real boy? he asks in amazement
Blue Fairy	No, Pinocchio. To make Geppetto�s wish come true will be enterely up to you.
Pinocchio	Up to me?
Blue Fairy	Prove yourself brave, truthful and unselfish, and someday you will be a real boy.
Pinocchio	A real boy!
Jiminy Cricket	That won�t be easy.
Blue Fairy	You must learn to chose between right and wrong.
Pinocchio	Right� and wrong? looking his hands But how will I know?
Jiminy Cricket	How�ll he know!
Blue Fairy	Your conscience will tell you.
Pinocchio	What are a conscience?
Jiminy Cricket	What are a conscience! I�ll tell ya! A conscience is that still small voice people won�t listen to. That�s just the trouble with the world today.
Pinocchio	Are you my conscience?
Jiminy Cricket	Who, me?
Blue Fairy	Hmmm. Would you like to be Pinocchio�s conscience?
Jiminy Cricket	embarrassed Well� uh, I, I--- Uh-huh.
Blue Fairy	Very well! What is your name?
Jiminy Cricket	Oh, Cricket�s the name. Jiminy Cricket.
Blue Fairy	Kneel, Mr. Cricket.
Jiminy Cricket	Huh? No tricks now.

Jiminy Cricket	Well! Ho-ho-ho! My,my! when he rises his shabby old clothes are gone and he�s clad in elegant raiment from head to foot Mmm! Say, that�s pretty swell. Gee� thanks! But� don�t I get a badge or something?
Blue Fairy	We�ll see
Jiminy Cricket	You mean maybe I will?
Blue Fairy	I shouldn�t wander.
Jiminy Cricket	Make it a gold one?
Blue Fairy	Maybe. Now remember, Pinocchio, be a good boy. And always let your conscience be your guide the Blue Fairy backs slowly away
Jiminy Cricket	Goodbye Milady.
Pinocchio	Goodbye.
Jiminy Cricket	humming Not bad, says I Oh yeah! Ho-ho-ho! Almost forgot about you. Well, Pinoke, maybe you and I� had better have a little heart-to-heart talk.
Pinocchio	Why?
Jiminy Cricket	Well, you want to be a real boy, don�t you?
Pinocchio	Aha!
Jiminy Cricket	All right. Sit down, son. Now you see the world is full of temptations.
Pinocchio	Temptations.
Jiminy Cricket	Yep! Temptations. They�re the wrong things that seem right at the time but� even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes, sometimes the wrong things chuckles may be right at the wrong time or� visa versa. Ahem. Understand?
Pinocchio	Uh-uh. But I�m gonna do right!
Jiminy Cricket	Atta boy, Pinoke, and I�m gonna help ya! And anytime you need me, you know, just whistle like this whistle

Geppetto	Who is there?
Pinocchio	It�s me.
Geppetto	Ahh! It�s me. Huh? Shhh, Figaro! There�s somebody in here.
Figaro	Meow
Geppetto	Shh! Careful now, Figaro. He might spring out on us at anytime. He�s in here, somewhere.

Night. Geppetto�s home. He has cooked a delicious supper in Pinocchio�s honor.
Geppetto	What could have happened to him? Where could he be at this hour? I�d better go out again and look for him. And remember, nobody eats a bite� until I find him he goes out and Figaro sees his opportunity to eat his meal, but Cleo gurgles remembering their promise

Echo	Needs a little oil� Needs a little oil�
Jiminy Cricket	That�s what I said. Woo-hoo-hoo! Must be one of the old models.
Pinocchio	You mean you can�t open it?
Jiminy Cricket	Yeah. Looks pretty hopeless. It�ll take a miracle to get us outta here.
Pinocchio	Gee.
Meanwhile Geppetto continues looking for Pinocchio in the rain.
Geppetto	Pinocchio? Pinocchio!
Stromboli	Giddy up! mumbling
Geppetto	Pinocch--- he has been so close to Pinocchio but he doesn�t know
Inside the carriage.
Jiminy Cricket	A fine conscience I turned out to be.
Pinocchio	crying I should-a listened to you, Jiminy.
Jiminy Cricket	No, it was my fault. I shouldn�t have walked out on you.
Pinocchio	Guess I�ll never see my father again.
Jiminy Cricket	Oh, buck up, son. It could be worse. Be cheerful� like me! Aw, take it easy son. Come on, blow. Atta boy. Oh well, it stopped raining anyway. Hey, that star again! The lady! The Fairy! the star shines through the clouds

Blue Fairy	You see, Pinocchio, a lie keeps growing and growing until it�s as plain as the nose on your face.

Jiminy Cricket	Please Your Honour, uh, I mean� Miss Fairy. Give him another chance for my sake. Will ya? Huh?
