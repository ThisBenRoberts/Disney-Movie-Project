It�s Christmas day of the year 1910 and a very special one for a young couple because it�s their first one together. Jim Dear hands his wife, Darling, a gift box tied with a big ribbon.
Jim	It�s for you Darling, Merry Christmas.
Darling	Oh, Jim dear! It�s the one I was admiring, isn�t it? Trimmed with ribbons
Jim	Well, it has a ribbon the box is opened and appears a puppy
Darling	Oh how sweet!
Jim	You like her darling?
Darling	Oh I love her! What a perfect beautiful little lady.
The night has come and Lady must go to bed� but she doesn�t like her �bed�
Jim	Come on, Lady. Over here. That�s a girl. There now. A nice little bed for you.
Darling	But Jim, dear, are you sure she will be warm enough?
Jim	Why of course not? She�ll be snug as a bug in a - ah ah. Almost forgot something. There. Goodnight Lady. to Darling Now, now. Don�t worry darling. She�ll go right to sleep. But Lady follows them No, no Lady. There is where you belong. Right here. Jim puts her in the basket again, but she follows them yipping
Darling	Ah, look she�s lonesome. Don�t you thing, maybe, just for a night?
Jim	Now darling, if we are going to show her who�s master we must be firm from the very beginning. he puts Lady in the basket once more but now, to be sure she�s not going to follow them again, he puts a chair in front of the door, so, in this way Lady must be stay in her place. She whimpers loud Lady, stop that now. Stop it whimpering resumes. Howling Lady quiet now. Do ya hear me? Back to bed. Quick now. Not one more sound.
It�s two o�clock in the morning and Lady is scraping, trying to escape. She goes upstairs and find her new bedroom. She whimpers there.
Darling	Jim dear
Jim	groans Lady whimpers and howls again
Darling	Aw Jim.
Jim	Hmm? What? What? Oh! yawning Oh, all right. But remember, just for tonight. he puts Lady on the bed
Time pass and we see Lady sleeping in the same place of the bed� but she�s a puppy no more.
Cock crowing. Lady opens her eyes. It�s a new day. She says good morning to her masters. They must be awaken
Jim	yawning All right Lady. All right. I�m up. I�m up Lady. Oh no!
Darling	What�s wrong Jim? What is it?
Jim	Can�t you explain to Lady about Sundays?
Meanwhile, Lady goes downstairs to do her daily homework. She sees a rat near the house and goes after her, but then, she hears the bicycle ring belling and must catch the paper.

It�s breakfast time. We see Jim trying to read the paper with an enormous hole in the middle.
Jim	Have you notice Darling, since we�ve had Lady we see less and less of those disturbing headlines?
Darling	Yes. I don�t know how we ever got along without her.
Jim	She must be about six months old. We�d better be getting her a licence.
Scene changes. Darling is opening a box for Lady. There�s her licence inside.
Darling	Hope it fits. My, but it does look nice. So grown up. Won�t Jock and Trusty be surprised?
Another dog is in scene. It�s Jock, a Scottish neighbour friend of Lady. He�s hiding a bone in his secret place.
Jock	Four steps ahead then turn to the left
And right to the place I marked it
With the bonny, bonny bone
That I�ll bury for me own
In my bonny, bonny bank
In the backyard
Ah that�s a great sight
Lady	She goes around proudly to show her new collar and licence to her two close friends, Jock and Trusty Jock!. Oh Jock. Hello Jock.
Jock	he is sitting over his treasure trying to hide it Oh, oh it�s you lassie
Lady	Notice anything different?
Jock	Uh, you�ve had a bath?
Lady	No, not that.
Jock	You�ve had your nails clipped?
Lady	Uh, uh. Guess again.
Jock	Well, I-I wouldn�t be a knowin� then. Why lassie a bonny new collar.
Lady	Do ya like it?
Jock	Aye. It must be very expensive. Have you shown it to Trusty?
Lady	No.
Jock	We�d best go at once. You know how sensitive he is �aboot� these things.
Trusty�s house. He is snoring and whimpering in dreams.
Lady	He�s dreaming.
Jock	Aye, dreaming of those bonny bygone days when he and his grandfather were trackin� criminals through the swamps.
Lady	They were?
Jock	that was before �
Lady	interrupting Before what?
Jock	�Tis time you knew the truth lassie. It shouldn�t happened to a dog but, well, Trusty lost his sense of smell
Lady	No!
Jock	Aye! But we must never let on that we know lassie. It would break his poor heart
Trusty	He is sniffing in dreams and looking for a �criminal� -in fact, a little striped caterpillar-, and wakes up when he tops with his friends Uh, which way did he go? Which way did he go?
Jock	Go?
Trusty	Yeah, big fella. About six foot two. No, uh, three. Wore a stripe suit. No collar. the caterpillar is proud with the description Why, Miss Lady! You have a collar.
Lady	Mm-hmm. And a licence.
Trusty	My, my, how time does fly!
Jock	Aye, it seems only yesterday she was cuttin� her teeth on Jim Dear slippers, and now there she is a full grown lady
Trusty	Wearing the greatest honour man can bestow.
Jock	The badge of faith and respectability.
Trusty	That�s right Miss Lady. As my grandpappy Old Reliable used to say� Don�t recollect if I�ve ever mentioned Old Reliable before.
Jock	Aye, ya have, lady
Trusty	Oh yeah.
Lady	It�s Jim Dear. Please, excuse me. Lady spots that Jim Dear in on his way home; she runs, as is her habit, to race with him back to the front door
Jim	Hello there Lady. Come on. Beat you home. Oh you win again. Steady now. Steady. He looks her licence Well, what have we here? Oh, big girl now, huh? opening the door All right. Oh, ladies first.
Scene changes and we see Jim, Darling and Lady in front of the fire place.
Jim	You know, Darling, with Lady here I�d say life is quite complete.
Darling	Yes dear, I don�t imagine anything could ever take her place in our hearts.
In an old railway station we discover a dog, sleeping until the train�s whistle makes him to open his eyes. It�s our friend Tramp.
Tramp	Ah, what a day! Well, now to dig up some breakfast. He walks trough his neighbourhood and finally stops in front of a pets animal shop�s window. Oh. Humm. Cute little rascals. Coochie, coochie, coochie coo Chuckles Now that breakfast. Let�s see. Bernie�s? Hmm? No. Francois? No, no nope. Too much starch. Ah Tony�s. That�s it. Haven�t been there in a week We hear a man singing in Italian
Tony	And the call it bella notte� Tramp scratches in the door. Well buongiorno, Butch. You want your breakfast, eh? Okay. The boss, he save a some a nice a bones for you. Breakfast a coming up from a left-field. Ha-ha, good catch!
Our friend is taking his breakfast when he hears a wagon stops so close. It�s the dog pound wagon.
Dog Catcher	Whoa, boy, whoa He puts and advertisement in the wall which reads as follows: Warning. Notice hereby given that any unlicensed dog will be immediately impounded. By order of City Council
Tramp	Hey. Psst. Psst.
Bull	Ha, ha, ha Blimey. Look, Peg. It�s the Tramp.
Tramp	Shh.
Peg	Hiya, handsome. Come to join the party?
Tramp	All right, all right. No time for wisecracks. I�ve got to get ya out. I�m telling ya the pressure�s really hot. Signs all over the town.
Peg	Gee, thanks.
Bull	You�re a bit of all right, chum.
Tramp	Okay, okay. Get going.
Dog Catcher	Hey, what�s going on over there!
Tramp	Scream! And be careful! He�s hidden under the wagon and when the man appears he bits his leg
Dog Catcher	What you mangy mutt. Hey, let go! Let go of me! Tramp runs away in the opposite direction and distracts the man
Tramp	Well, snob hill, ha. He is in Lady�s neighbourhood Hi gals to the pigeons How�s pickings? Pretty slim, eh? Yeah. I�ll bet they�ve got a lid on every trash can. Uh-oh. And a fence around every tree. I wonder what the leash and collar set does for excitement.
At Lady�s home. Jock and Trusty go to visit her.
Jock	Lassie! Lassie!
Trusty	Oh Miss Lady, Ma�am! Miss Lady.
Jock enters in the yard looking for her and finds Lady looking unhappy.
Jock	A good mornin� Lassie! �Tis a bony, braw bright day, uh, today.
Trusty	Why, Miss Lady, is something wrong?
Jock	Aye, tell us Lassie. If somebody�s been mistreatin� ya�
Lady	Oh no Jock. It�s something I�ve done, I guess.
Trusty	You?
Lady	It must be. Jim Dear and Darling are acting so� Darling is humming
Trusty	Jim Dear and Darling?
Jock	Hush man! they go after the greenhouse Now, Lassie, get on with the details.
Lady	Well I first noticed it the other day when Jim Dear came home.
We see the scene as Lady is relating it: She was looking through the window and when she saw Jim Dear went to him, but that day Jim Dear didn�t interest in playing with her as he used to.
Jim	Down, Lady. Down. Darling, Darling? Are you all right?
Darling	Of course I am, why shouldn�t I be?
Jim	I just can�t help worrying. After all, in your condition, alone here all day walking that dog.
We come back to the present. Her friends are surprised.
Jock	�That dog�
Trusty	That dog.
Lady	He�s never called me that before.
Jock	Well now Lassie, I wouldn�t worry my wee head aboot that. Remember. They�re only humans after all.
Trusty	That�s right Miss Lady. As my grandpappy, Old Reliable, used to say. Don�t recollect if I�ve ever mentioned Old Reliable before.
Jock	Aye, ya have laddie. Frequently.
Trusty	oh, yeah.
Lady	But now Darling is� Well, we�ve always enjoined pour afternoon romp together. But yesterday�
Lady�s relating the episode. She wants to walk as always with Darling, but that day she�s so busy doing something Lady doesn�t understand. And she�s always humming.
Darling	No Lady. No walk today. Then Lady takes his ball to play with her No Lady. Not now. A wool ball fells down and Lady tries to play with it, but Darling �s angry Lady. Drop that Lady. Drop it, I say! she hits lightly Lady
We come back to the present, and Lady is explaining her feelings.
Lady	It didn�t hurt really. But Darling has never struck me before.
Jock and Trusty look each other and smile. They know what�s happening.
Jock	Now lassie. Do no take it too seriously. After all, at a time like this�
Trusty	Why, yes, you see, Miss Lady. There comes a time in the life of all humans when, uh.. Well as they put it, uh, the birds and the bees. Or, well, uh, the stork you know? Uh, no? Well, uh�
Jock	What he�s tryin� to say lassie is Darling is expecting a wee �bairn�.
Lady	�Bairn�?
Trusty	He means a baby, Miss Lady
Lady	Oh! What�s a baby? Tramp has just arrived to hear the question
Jock	Well, they. They resemble humans.
Trusty	But I�d say a mite smaller.
Jock	Aye, and they walk on all fours.
Trusty	And if I remember correctly they �beller� a lot.
Jock	Aye and they are very expensive. You�ll not be permitted to play with it.
Trusty	But they�re mighty sweet.
Jock	And very, very soft.
And that moment the mongrel Tramp arrives. He is much more cynical about babies that Jock and Trusty.
Tramp	Yes a cute little bundle chuckles of trouble. Yes they scratch, pinch, pull ears. Ah but shucks any dog can take that. It�s what they do to your happy home. Move it over, will ya friend? Home wreckers! That�s what they are!
Jock	Look here laddie. Who are you to barge in?
Tramp	The voice of experience, buster. Just wait till Junior gets here. You get the urge for a nice comfortable scratch and� falsetto �put that dog out. He�ll get fleas all over the baby�. You start barking at some strange mutt barking. Falsetto �Stop that racket, you�ll wake the baby� And then they hit you in the room and board department. Remember those nice juicy cuts of beef? Forget �em. Leftover baby food. And that nice warm bed by the fire? A leaky doghouse.
Lady	Oh dear.
Jock	do not listen lassie. No human is that cruel!
Trusty	Of course not Miss Lady. Why, everybody knows a dog�s best friend is his human.
Tramp	laughing Oh come now fellas. You haven�t fallen for that old line now, have ya?
Jock	Awe, and we�ve no need for mongrels and their radical ideas. Off with ya now! Off with ya!
Tramp	Okay Sandy.
Jock	The name�s Jock.
Tramp	Okay Jock.
Jock	heather Lad o�Glencairn to you
Tramp	Okay, okay, okay. But remember this Pigeon, a human heart has only so much room for love and affection. When a baby moves in, the dog moves out.
Lady is astonished and worried.
Jim	Aha! Now Let�s see. That�ll be about� oh well he marks all the month In the baby�s room Jim Dear is pounding Darling. There isn�t any way we can tell for sure what�s is going to be, is there? Lady thinks about Tramp�s warning a lot during the next months
Darling	I�m afraid not. Nobody ever knows for certain she�s writing a list of different names All we can do is� hope.
Time pass. In a freeze January night, Jim Dear has to go out�
Jim	Darling? Are you sure you want watermelon?
Darling	Mm-hmm. And some chop suey too.
Jim	Chop suey! Oh! All right Darling!
February. A party� The house is full of people chattering and laughing.
Women	That�s the cutest little thing I ever saw.
And that bonet! Isn�t it just adorable?
Don�t you just love showers?
Darling, I�ve never seen you look more beautiful.
Isn�t she absolutely radiant?
Radiant! Why, that�s just I told Bill yesterday!. �Bill -I said- Darling looks radiant, positively radiant�. Why, in all my days -I said- I�ve never seen anyone as radiant as Darling.
Lady abandons the room and goes where men are. But the situation is similar.
Men	Jim, you look terrible!
Absolutely horrible!
I never saw ya look worse.
Cheer up, Jim. Old Doc Jones has never lost a father yet!
April. A raining night�
Jim	At the phone Yes Aunt Sarah, it�s a boy! U-Uh a boy! What�s that? Eyes? Oh, what colour are they? Well, oh gosh! I-I forget to look! he forgets the phone and runs A boy! It�s a boy! It�s a� Doctor! Doctor it�s a boy!
Doctor	Yes, yes, I know.
Jim	Aha, a boy! Oh boy, oh boy. It�s a boy. It�s a boy!
Aunt Sarah	at the phone Hello, hello Jim? Are you there Jim? Central, central, we�ve been cut off. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?

A Bright new day. A baby�s crying.
Lady's voice	What is a baby?

I just can't understand
it must be something wonderful
it must be something grand
'cause everybody's smiling
in a kind and wistful way
and they haven't even noticed
that I'm around today

What is a baby, anyway?

Oh, what is a baby?
I must find out today
what makes Jim Dear and Darling
act this way.
She enters in the baby�s room, so quietly� Darling has in her arms the baby and is singing a lullaby.
Darling	La, la lu
La, la lu
oh, my little star sweeper
I'll sweep the stardust for you

La, la lu
La, la lu
little soft fluffy sleeper
here comes a pink cloud for you

La, la lu
La, la lu
Little wandering angel
fold up your wings, close your eyes

La, la lu
La, la lu
And may love be your keeper

La, la lu
La, la lu
La, la lu

There now, little star sweeper, dream on
Lady wants to see the baby, but she doesn�t want to disturb, but Jim and Darling helps her. Now Lady is happy again. We see her wagging her tail joyfully.
Jim	Well that should do it. We got enough here to take us halfway to China. Darling, Darling? We haven�t much time.
Darling	Jim, I just can�t leave him. He�s still so small and helpless
Jim	He�ll be all right. Now come on. If he wakes up, we�ll never get away.
Darling	But Jim I feel so guilty deserting him like this.
Jim	Nonsense. Hey, what�s the matter with Lady? Lady is angry with them
Darling	She thinks we�re running out on him.
Jim	Awe don�t worry my old girl. We�ll be back in a few days.
Darling	Aunt Sarah will be here. Lady smiles. She understands they are not leaving alone their baby
Jim	With you here to help her. Door�s bell There�s the old girl now. Coming Aunt Sarah! Coming!
Aunt Sarah	Sorry I�m late dears. Hope I haven�t kept you waiting.
Jim	Here, let me take your things.
Aunt Sarah	No, no, No fussing. I know my way around. On your way now. Mustn�t miss your train. Have a good time and don�t worry about a thing. Goodbye dear. Goodbye, goodbye.
Darling	Goodbye!
Jim	Goodbye!
Aunt Sarah	She closes the door leaving Lady outside, but she enters by her own door, and goes upstairs to the baby�s room And now to see that big nephew of mine. Coochie, coochie, coochie, coochie. Oh you adorable little� gasps God gracious! What are you doing here? Go on now. Shoo, shoo. Scat. Get out of here! Lady has to go out and the baby starts to cry There, there. Aunt Sarah won�t let that dog frighten you anymore. No, no, no, no, dear.
Out of the key Rock a bye a baby on the treetop
When the wind blows
Lady goes downstairs so sad. She was not going to do any harm the baby. She pass in front of a basket which opens a little to show two pair of eyes�
Si and Am	We are Siamese if you please
we are Siamese if you don't please
now we lookin' over our new domicile
if we like we stay for maybe quite a while

Do you seeing that thing swimming round and round? Yes
Maybe we could reaching in and make it drown
if we sneaking up upon it carefully
there will be a head for you, a tail for me

Do you hear what I hear? A baby cry
where we finding baby, there are milk nearby
if we look in baby buggy, there could be
plenty milk for you and also some for me
They have been trying to eat the bird and the fish but Lady stops them. The fight and break a lot of things making too much noise. When Aunt Sarah appears the cats simulate they have been hurt by Lady.
Aunt Sarah	What�s going on down there? Merciful heavens! My darlings! My precious pets!. Oh, oh, that wicked animal. Attacking my poor, innocent, little angels. Aunt Sarah assumes that Lady has attacker her two cats gratuitously and has Lady muzzled
Scene changes. We see Aunt Sarah with Lady enter in a pet store. She wants to buy a muzzle.
Pet Store Clerk	Good afternoon ma�am. What can I do for you?.
Aunt Sarah	I want a muzzle. A good, strong muzzle.
Pet Store Clerk	Yes ma�am. Here�s out latest combination leash and muzzle. We�ll just slip it on like this. And oh, no, no.
Aunt Sarah	Lady!
Pet Store Clerk	Nice doggy. No, no. Don�t wiggle. Steady now! Now, now, now. Careful you little�
Aunt Sarah	Watch out!
Pet Store Clerk	Doggy, careful doggy
Aunt Sarah	Come back. Come back here I say! Come back here!
Lady runs away so frightened. She doesn�t know where she is going to or what she is going to do but she continues running away. Suddenly she�s being chased by some vicious street-dogs. But she�s lucky because our friend Tramp spots her and chases off her pursuers.
Tramp	Hey Pige, what are you doing on this side of the tracks? I though you�Wha� Oh you poor kid. Oh, we�ve gotta get this off. I think I know the very place. Tramp reckon that the best way to get rid of the muzzle is to take her to the zoo to find an animal with teeth sharp enough to cope with the task Come on. Taking Lady�s leash in his mouth he led her to the zoo Well , here we are.
Lady	The zoo?
Tramp	Sure! No, no, this way. Follow me.
Lady	Oh!
Tramp	What�s the matter Pige?
Lady	We can�t go in?
Tramp	Why not?
Lady	Well, the sign says We can read �No dogs allowed�
Tramp	Yeah, well, well that�s� That�s the angle.
Lady	Angle?
Tramp	Look, we�ll just wait for the right� Uh-oh. Here we are now. Just lay low. A typical English man goes out the zoo and Tramp receives him as his master attracting the policeman attention on him
Policeman	Hey you!
Professor	Uh, I beg your pardon. Were you addressing me?
Policeman	What�s the matter? Can�t you read? He shows him the signal
Professor	Why, yes, several languages.
Policeman	Oh a wise guy, eh? All right now. What�s this creature doin� here?
Professor	He�s not my dog! Tramp jumps to his arms
Policeman	Oh, he�s not eh?
Professor	Go away. Go on. Why certainly not officer.
Policeman	Awe, I suppose you�ll be tellin� me next it was the dog that was whistlin�, eh?
Professor	I-I�m certainly don�t know
Policeman	Oh I�m a liar now, am I?
Professor	Well, you listen to me.
Policeman	Aha! Resistin� an officer of the law. You�re gonna to pay! Tramp bits him Oh! Pull a knife on me, will ya? Tryin� to assassinate me, aren�t ya?. Carryin� a concealed weapon! they continue arguing and Tramp enters in the zoo with Lady
Tramp	Come on, Pige. The place is ours. We�d better go through this place from A to Z. Apes. No, no, no. No use even asking them. They will not understand.
Lady	They wouldn�t?
Tramp	Uh-uh. Too closely related with humans. Uh-oh Alligators! Now, there�s an idea. to the alligator Say Al, do you suppose your could nip this contraption off for us?
Alligator	Glad to oblige He opens his mouth showing his big teeth
Tramp	whoa, whoa! Hmmpf. If anybody ever needed a muzzle, it�s him.
Beaver	Timber!
Tramp	Hey Pigeon, look out! What harebrained idiot would� Hey, look. A beaver. Here�s the answer to our problem.
Beaver	Let me see here. Six foot six and seven sixteenth inches.
Tramp	Pardon me friend. I wonder if you�d do us a little�
Beaver	Busy, sonny, busy. Can�t stop to gossip now. Gotta slide this sycamore to the� swamp.
Tramp	This will only take you a second of your time.
Beaver	Only a second? L-listen, listen sonny. Do you realize every second� 70 centimetres of water is wasted over that spillway?
Tramp	Yeah, but�
Beaver	Gotta get this log movin� sonny. Gotta get it movin� That the cuttin� takes the time. It�s the doggone haulin�.
Tramp	The haulin� Exactly. Now, what you need is�
Beaver	Better bisect this section here.
Tramp	What you need is a log puller shouting I said a log puller.
Beaver	I ain�t �deef� sonny. There�s no need to� Did you say log puller?
Tramp	And, by a lucky coincidence, you see before you modelled by the lovely little lady, the new improved, patented, handy-dandy, never fail, little giant long puller. The busy beaver�s friend.
Beaver	You don�t say!.
Tramp	Guaranteed not to wear, tear, rip or ravel. Turn around sister and show the customer the merchandise. And it cuts logs hauling time 66%.
Beaver	sixty six per cent, eh? chuckles Think of that! Well, how�s it work?
Tramp	Why, it�s no work at all. You merely slip this ring over the limb, like this, and haul it off.
Beaver	Say you mind if I slip it on for size.
Tramp	Help yourself, friend!
Beaver	Okay, don�t mind if I do. How do you get the �conserned� thing off, sonny?
Tramp	Glad you brought that up, friend. To remove it, simply place the strap between your teeth.
Beaver	Like this?
Tramp	Correct friend. Now, bite hard! Ya see?
Lady	It�s off.
Beaver	Say, that is simple.
Tramp	Well, friend, we�ll be on our way now, so�
Beaver	Uh-uh- Not so fast now, sonny. I�ll have to make certain it�s satisfactory before we settle on a price.
Tramp	Oh no, it�s all yours, friend. You can keep it.
Beaver	Uh. I can huh? I can?
Lady	Aha, it�s a free sample
Beaver	Well, thanks a lot! Thanks ever so� Say! It works swell!
Scene changes. Lady and the Tramp are walking by the street and she�s telling him about the muzzle.
Lady	But when she put me that horrible muzzle on me�
Tramp	Say no more. I get the hole picture. Aunts, cats, muzzles. Well that�s what comes of tying yourself down to one family.
Lady	Haven�t you a family?
Tramp	One for every day of the week. The point is, none of them have me.
Lady	I�m afraid I don�t understand.
Tramp	It�s simple. You see sniff Hey! Something tells me it�s supper time. Come on, I�ll show you what I mean. Now take the Schultzes here. Little Fritzie� That�s me Pige� makes this his Monday home.
Lady	Monday home?

Afterwards Tramps takes Lady for a romantic stroll in the park. Scene changes. We hear a roster crowing, and our friends, Tramp and Lady, wake up.
Lady	Oh! Oh, dear!
Tramp	Is something wrong Pige?
Lady	It�s morning.
Tramp	Yeah. Hmmm. So it is
Lady	I should have been home hours ago.
Tramp	Why? Because you still believe in that �ever faithful old dog Trey� routine? Oh, come on, Pige. Open up your eyes.
Lady	Open my eyes?
Tramp	To what a dog�s life can really be. Show ya what I mean. Look down there. Tell me what you see.
Lady	Well I see nice homes with yards and fences�
Tramp	Exactly. Life on a leash. Look again Pige. Look there�s a great big hunk of world down there with no fence around it where two dogs can find adventure and excitement, and beyond those distant hills who knows what wonderful experiences. And it�s all ours for the taking, Pige. It�s all ours.
Lady	It sounds wonderful.
Tramp	But?
Lady	But who �d watch over the baby?
Tramp	He agrees reluctantly to escort her You win. Come on. I�ll take ya home.
In their way we see the City pound wagon again.
Tramp	humming It�s a beautiful night
And they call it bella�
Suddenly he sees chickens. It�s fun time Not to change the subject but, ever, chase chickens?
Lady	I should say not.
Tramp	Oh, oh! Then you�ve never lived!
Lady	But we shouldn�t.
Tramp	I know. That�s what makes it fun. Aw, come on kid. Start building some memories.
Lady	But we, we won�t hurt the chickens.
Tramp	Hurt �em? No! we�ll just stir �em up a bit. Just look those fat, lazy biddies. They should have been up hours ago. He barks and all the chickens and Lady also, run away, horrified Some fun, eh kid?
Man	Hey, what�s goin� on in there? he fires
Lady	What�s there?
Tramp	That�s the signal to get going. Come on! Whee! This is livin� eh kid?
Lady	Is it?
Tramp	Come on Pige. Follow me. Lady has been captured and taken to the City pound where she meets some of Tramp�s friends You know, there�s a little bit of bird dog in all of us, eh, Pige? Pige? Pige? Pige? Where are ya, Pige? Pige! Pigeon! Oh Pige!

Dog pound. We hear a lot of barks and howls. We see a group of assorted dogs humming and howling the song �Home Sweet Home�. The four singers are Toughy, an American mongreal; Boris, a Russian wolfhound; Pedro, a Mexican Chihuahua, and Bull, an English bulldog. Their singing is a sonic camouflage: Dachsie, a dachshound is digging a tunnel under the wall.
Toughy	Hey, hey Dachsie, how we comin�?
Dachsie	One just more chorus and we�re out.
Toughy	Okay, on a downbeat. One, two� a door creaking: Lady�s coming
Man	Put her in number four, Bill, while I check her licence number.
Bill	Okay . All right baby, in here.
Toughy	Well, well, look youse guys Miss Park Avenue herself.
Bull	Blimey, a regular bloomin� debutantee.
Toughy	Yeah and pipe the crown jewel she�s wearin�.
Bull	Yeah What ya in for sweetheart? Puttin� fleas on the butler laughs
Peg	All right, all right you guys. Lay off, will ya?
Toughy	What�s the matter Peg?
Bull	We was only havin� a bit of sport, we was.
Peg	Can�t ya see the poor kid�s scared enough already?
Boris	Pay no attention my little �orchechornya�.
Peg	That�s right deerie. They don�t mean no real hurt.
Boris	Is like Gorky says in Lower Dapts: �Miserable beings must find more miserable being�then is happy�
Peg	Boris is a philosopher.
Boris	Besides little �bublichki� wearing licence here, that is like waving. You should excuse the expression red flag in front of bull.
Lady	My licence? But what�s wrong with it?
Peg	There ain�t nothin� wrong with it, deerie.
Boris	Confidential. Is not one dog here would not give left hind leg for such a knick-knack.
Peg	That�s your passport to freedom, honey. Without it�
Toughy	Hey, hey, youse guys, look. Poor Nutsy is takin� the long walk.
Lady	Where is he takin� him?
Toughy	Through the one-way door sister.
Lady	You.. you mean, he�s�
Bull	Oh well, a short life and a merry one.
Toughy	Yeah, that�s what that Tramp always says.
Lady	The Tramp?
Bull	There�s a bloke what never gets caught.
Toughy	He�s given the slip to every dog catcher in this burg.
Peg	You won�t believe this, dearie, but no matter how tight a jam he�s in the Tramp always finds some way out.
Lady	I can quite easily believe that.
Boris	But, remember my friends, even Tramp has his Achilles heel.
Pedro	Pardon me, amigo, what is this �chilli heel�?
Boris	Achilles heel, Pedro. This is meaning his, uh, weaknesses.
Toughy	Oh, oh, the dames yeah!
Bull	He has an eye for a well-turned paw, he has. Let�s see there�s been Lulu
Toughy	Yeah, and Trixie.
Dachsie	Und Fifi.
Pedro	And my sister Rosita Chiquita Juanita Chihuahua, I think.
Peg	What a dog!
Toughy	Yeah, tell us about it, Peg.
Peg	What a dog!
Bull	Peg used to be in the Dog and Pony Follies.
Peg	He's a tramp
but they love him
breaks a new heart every day

He's a tramp
they adore him
and I only hope he'll stay that way

He's a tramp
he's a scoundrel
he's a rounder
he's a cad
he's a tramp
but I love him
yes, even I have got it pretty bad

You never can tell when he'll show up
he gives you plenty of trouble

I guess he's just a no-'count pup
but I wish that he were double

He's a tramp
he's a rover
and there's nothing more to say
if he's a tramp, he's a good one
and I wish that I could travel his way
wish that I could travel his way
wish that I could travel his way
Toughy	Yeah, but he never takes �em serious.
Boris	Ah, but someday he is meeting someone different, some delicate, fragile creature who is giving him a wish to shelter and protect.
Bull	Like Miss Park Avenue here, eh, matey?
Boris	Mmmm. Could be. But when he does�
Peg	Yah, I�m a way ahead of ya. Under the spell of true love�
Bull	The poor chump grows careless..
Boris	The Cossacks are picking him up
Toughy	and it�s curtains for the Tramp.
Man	It�s the little cocker, Bill in the number four..
Bill	Okay. All right baby. They�ve come to take ya home. You�re too nice a girl to be in this place.
Lady�s home. She has returned but now she chained in disgrace to an outdoor kennel.
Jock	Courage, man, courage!.
Trusty	But I�ve never even considered matrimony.
Jock	Nor I, but no matter which of us she accepts, we�ll always be the best of friends. Now remember, not a word �aboot� her unfortunate experience. You don�t want to hurt her feelings.
Trusty	Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jock	Lassie!
Trusty	Miss Lady, ma�am.
Lady	Please, I don�t want to see anybody.
Jock	Now, now lassie. Do not feel that way about it.
Trusty	Of course not, Miss Lady. Why, some of the finest people I ever tracked down were jailbirds.
Jock	Quiet! You great loony! Uh, please, lassie, we�ve come with a proposition for helpin� ya.
Lady	Help me!. What do you mean?
Jock	Well, now, you see lassie, neither of us is as young as we used to be.
Trusty	But we�re still in the prime of life.
Jock	Awe, and we both got very comfortable homes.
Trusty	That�s right. Where we know you�ll be welcome and appreciated, Miss Lady.
Jock	So to come directly to the point clears his throat
Trusty	If you could, uh, find it possible� to uh, to uh
Lady	You�re both very kind and I do appreciate it, but�
When Tramp comes to apologize, the three of them refuses to listen to him.
Tramp	Oh Pigeon!, Oh Pige! Oh hi boys! Anything new in the kennel club, eh? Little something I picked up for ya Pige.
Lady	Humph!
Tramp	Looks like I�m the one that�s in the doghouse.
Trusty	If this person is annoyin� Miss Lady�
Jock	We�ll gladly throw the rascal out!
Lady	That won�t be necessary. Thank you.
Trusty	Very well, ma�am.
Jock	You� you mongrel!
Tramp	Aw, come on, Pige. It wasn�t my fault.
Lady	Humph!
Tramp	I though you were right behind me. Honest! When I heard they�d taken you to the pound---
Lady	Oh, don�t even mention that horrible place. I was so embarrassed and frightened.
Tramp	Oh, now, now, now. Who could ever harm a cute little trick like you?
Lady	Trick? Trick? That reminds me. Who is Trixie?
Tramp	Trixie?
Lady	and Lulu? And Fifi? And Rosita Chiquita�whatever her name is?
Tramp	Ch-Chiquita, oh, oh, yes, well I�
Lady	As far as I am concerned you needn�t worry about your old heel.
Tramp	M-My heel?
Lady	I don�t need you to shelter and protect me.
Tramp	Yes, but-but�
Lady	If you grow careless, don�t blame me. And I don�t care if the Cossacks do pick you up. Goodbye! And take this with you.she rejects his bone and starts sobbing. Tramp goes away saying nothing. A rat that has been haunting the area sees that Lady is chained up, and takes the opportunity to sneak up to the baby�s room. Lady strains against her chain and barks furiously.
Aunt Sarah	opening a window Stop that! Hush! Now! Hush! Stop that racket!
Tramp	Tramp, hearing the commotion comes rushing back, and chases after the rat up to the baby�s room where he kills it. What�s wrong Pige?
Lady	A rat!
Tramp	Where?
Lady	Upstairs. In the baby�s room.
Tramp	How do I get in?
Lady	The little door on the porch.
Tramp enter in the house and sniffing he finds the rat in the baby�s room. A terrible fight starts. Lady continues barking and she success in breaking her chain, joins Tramp. When she arrives she sees how Tramp is fighting with the rat but the baby�s crib is on the floor but the baby�s right. While Lady watches over the baby, Tramp corners the rat at last behind the curtains and kills it. Aunt Sarah has heard the noise and the cries�
Aunt Sarah	Merciful heavens! Oh, you poor little darling. Now, now, now, now, now. Thank goodness you�re not harm. You-your vicious brutes. Back, get back! Go on! Get back! The pound! The pound! That�s it!! I�ll call the pound! She dashes in to find the two dogs who she assumes have been attacking the baby. Lady is locked in the cellar while Tramp is taken off to the pound. She has not seen the rat Come here you, come here. Come on. Come on. Come along! I�ll call them this minute. Couldn�t sleep a wink with that brute in the house. We hear a phone bell rings Hello! Hello! I don�t care if you�re alone there, young man. I insist you pick him up immediately.Lady tries to find a escape and helps her friend, but it�s of no use.
Scene changes. Jim Dear and Darling are going back home and see the City Pound Wagon in front of their house.
Jim	Darling, look.
Aunt Sarah	And if you want my advice, you�ll destroy that animal at once.
Dog Catcher	Don�t worry ma�am. We�ve been after this one for months. We�ll take care of him.
Darling	Well what do you suppose�
Jim	Hey, what�s going on here?
Dog Catcher	Just pickin� up a stray mister. Come on! Get up! Caught him attackin� a baby!
Jim	Good heavens!
Darling	My baby!
Jim	Aunt Sarah!
Darling	Aunt Sarah! Aunt Sarah!
Jim	Aunt Sarah!
Darling	Aunt Sarah!
Jock	I was certain he was no good the moment I first laid eyes on him.
Trusty	Yeah, but, uh, I never thought he�d do a thing like that.
Aunt Sarah	Thank goodness I got there in time. There they were, crib overturned�
Jim	I�m sure there must be some mistake. I know Lady wouldn�t�Lady rushes over to the curtains and barks louder
Aunt Sarah	Watch out! That dog�s loose! Keep her away!
Jim	Nonsense. She�s trying to tell us something. What is it old girl? What are you trying�? Jim lifts a corner of the courtain and there lay the dead rat. Then, they understand everythingDarling! Aunt Sarah! Come here!
Aunt Sarah	What is it, Jim? A rat!
Outside, Trusty and Jock have heard the news. So they decide not to waste any time on going after the dog catcher to stop him.
Trusty	A rat! We should have known.
Jock	I misjudged him�badly.
Trusty	Come on. We have to stop that wagon.
Jock	But man, we don�t know which way they�ve gone.
Trusty	We�ll track �em down.
Jock	A-a-and then?
Trusty	We�ll hold �em. Hold �em at bay
Jock	Now what?
Trusty	The scent. Follow the scent.
Jock	Let�s face it man. We both know you�ve lost your sense of smell. Using Trusty�s nonexistent sense of smell, they try to track down the wagon, and miraculously they do, racing after it with Jim dear and Darling not far behind in a cab. They succeed in stopping the wagon and saving Tramp, but in the excitement the wagon overturns, crushing poor Trusty
Dog Catcher	Go on! Get outta here! Go on you! Get away! Go on! Get away! Watch it now! Watch it! Watch it!
Tramp	Hi Pige! Both smile to each other
It�s Christmas time again: Jim Dear and Darling have quite a time getting them all in a Christmas picture, all holding still at the same time. The baby�s grown up and Lady and the Tramp have a litter of naughty puppies.
Jim	All right everybody! Watch the birdie! Steady now. Hold it! I guess I used a little too much. Uh-oh, Darling. Visitors.
Darling	Visitors? Why, it�s Jock!
Jim	And good old Trusty.
Yes, the poor old Trusty has only suffered a broken leg and he has a cast on it.
Jock	Careful man. Careful. It�s a wee bit slippery.
Trusty	Yes, yes.
Tramp	All right boy! We�ll let them in.
Darling	No, no, not you, young man. You�re going to take a nap.
Jim	Well, merry Christmas. Come in. Come in. If you just step in the parlour I�ll see about refreshments. Oh darling, where did you put the dog biscuits? You know, the box Aunt Sarah sent for Christmas.
Darling	In the kitchen, Jim Dear.
Trusty	Oh no doubt about it. They�ve got their mother�s eyes.
Jock	Aye. But there�s a bit of their father in �em too. Well and I see you finally acquired a collar.
Tramp	Oh yes, complete with licence.
Trusty	Oh yeah, a new collar. Caught the scent the moment I came in the house.
Jock	Trusty I says. Trusty somebody�s wearin� a new collar.
Trusty	Of course, now my sense of smell is very highly developed. Runs in the family, you know?
Jock	There�ll be no livin� with him from now on
Trusty	as my grandpappy, Old Reliable, used to say� I don�t recollect if I ever mentioned Old Reliable before?
Puppies	No you haven�t, Uncle Trusty.
Trusty	Huh? I haven�t? Well, uh, as Old Reliable used to say� He�d say, uh, uh, he�d say, uh, uh Uh-hmmm? Doggone! You know. I clean forgot what it was he used to say.
Off singing voice	Peace, my children of good will
peace, my children, peace, be still
